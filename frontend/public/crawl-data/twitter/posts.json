Connectionism will cover topics as varied as our research is: from kernel numerics to prompt engineering. Here we share what we are working on and connect with the research community frequently and openly.\n\nThe name Connectionism is a throwback to an earlier era of AI; it was the name of the subfield in the 1980s that studied neural networks and their similarity to biological brains.\n\nhttps://t.co/lrJioBmpbT",

      "text": "One way of thinking about what AI will automate first is via the “description-execution gap”: how much harder is it to describe the task than to actually do it?\n\nTasks with large description-execution gaps will be ripe for automation because it’s easy to create training data and the value of automating them is huge, even if execution is non-trivial:\n- Fixing grammar mistakes in a long piece of writing\n- Submitting receipts for reimbursement\n- Training a model that achieves performance of X on a standard evaluation benchmark\n- Building an app where the UI is easy to check but requires a lot of moving parts in the backend\n\nDescription-execution gaps tend to be small when the task is high-context and not technically challenging. The value of automating these is by definition smaller, and it’s harder to create data for them. For example:\n- Data processing scripts where the code to process the data is shorter and more precise than a natural language description\n- Running an ablation study in a high-context codebase that trains specialized models\n- Editing a video in a specific style (often easier to edit the video yourself than to describe how each little edit should be done)\n- Buying chinese groceries for my mom (she has very specific items and amounts, it's easier for her to go herself than to describe to me exactly the item, how to select the best fruit, etc)\n\nA bit similar to the discriminator-generator gap, but not exactly the same. Some things, like editing a video in a specific style, can have a large discriminator-generator gap but small description-execution gap",

      "text": "RL environment specs are among the most consequential things we can write as AI researchers. A relatively short spec (e.g., <1000 words of instructions saying what problems to create and how to grade them) often gets expanded either by humans or via synthetic methods into thousands of datapoints. Just one sentence in the spec can be the difference between a perfect post-trained model versus one with crazy hacking. Specs are also typically a product of a large amount of compute, where each training run allows us to iterate on the spec to patch reward hacking and get the nuances of model behavior just right. Writing a good spec requires context and taste and I don’t think AI can automate this just yet",

      "text": "Becoming an RL diehard in the past year and thinking about RL for most of my waking hours inadvertently taught me an important lesson about how to live my own life.\n\nOne of the big concepts in RL is that you always want to be “on-policy”: instead of mimicking other people’s successful trajectories, you should take your own actions and learn from the reward given by the environment. Obviously imitation learning is useful to bootstrap to nonzero pass rate initially, but once you can take reasonable trajectories, we generally avoid imitation learning because the best way to leverage the model’s own strengths (which are different from humans) is to only learn from its own trajectories. A well-accepted instantiation of this is that RL is a better way to train language models to solve math word problems compared to simple supervised finetuning on human-written chains of thought.\n\nSimilarly in life, we first bootstrap ourselves via imitation learning (school), which is very reasonable. But even after I graduated school, I had a habit of studying how other people found success and trying to imitate them. Sometimes it worked, but eventually I realized that I would never surpass the full ability of someone else because they were playing to their strengths which I didn’t have. It could be anything from a researcher doing yolo runs more successfully than me because they built the codebase themselves and I didn’t, or a non-AI example would be a soccer player keeping ball possession by leveraging strength that I didn’t have.\n\nThe lesson of doing RL on policy is that beating the teacher requires walking your own path and taking risks and rewards from the environment. For example, two things I enjoy more than the average researcher are (1) reading a lot of data, and (2) doing ablations to understand the effect of individual components in a system. Once when collecting a dataset, I spent a few days reading data and giving each human annotator personalized feedback, and after that the data turned out great and I gained valuable insight into the task I was trying to solve. Earlier this year I spent a month going back and ablating each of the decisions that I previously yolo’ed while working on deep research. It was a sizable amount of time spent, but through those experiments I learned unique lessons about what type of RL works well. Not only was leaning into my own passions more fulfilling, but I now feel like I’m on a path to carving a stronger niche for myself and my research.\n\nIn short, imitation is good and you have to do it initially. But once you’re bootstrapped enough, if you want to beat the teacher you must do on-policy RL and play to your own strengths and weaknesses :)",

      "text": "New blog post about asymmetry of verification and \"verifier's law\": https://t.co/28Ly8NHJWZ\n\nAsymmetry of verification–the idea that some tasks are much easier to verify than to solve–is becoming an important idea as we have RL that finally works generally.\n\nGreat examples of asymmetry of verification are things like sudoku puzzles, writing the code for a website like instagram, and BrowseComp problems (takes ~100 websites to find the answer, but easy to verify once you have the answer).\n\nOther tasks have near-symmetry of verification, like summing two 900-digit numbers or some data processing scripts. Yet other tasks are much easier to propose feasible solutions for than to verify them (e.g., fact-checking a long essay or stating a new diet like \"only eat bison\").\n\nAn important thing to understand about asymmetry of verification is that you can improve the asymmetry by doing some work beforehand. For example, if you have the answer key to a math problem or if you have test cases for a Leetcode problem. This greatly increases the set of problems with desirable verification asymmetry. \n\n\"Verifier's law\" states that the ease of training AI to solve a task is proportional to how verifiable the task is. All tasks that are possible to solve and easy to verify will be solved by AI. The ability to train AI to solve a task is proportional to whether the task has the following properties:\n1. Objective truth: everyone agrees what good solutions are\n2. Fast to verify: any given solution can be verified in a few seconds\n3. Scalable to verify: many solutions can be verified simultaneously\n4. Low noise: verification is as tightly correlated to the solution quality as possible\n5. Continuous reward: it’s easy to rank the goodness of many solutions for a single problem\n\nOne obvious instantiation of verifier's law is the fact that most benchmarks proposed in AI are easy to verify and so far have been solved. Notice that virtually all popular benchmarks in the past ten years fit criteria #1-4; benchmarks that don’t meet criteria #1-4 would struggle to become popular.\n\nWhy is verifiability so important? The amount of learning in AI that occurs is maximized when the above criteria are satisfied; you can take a lot of gradient steps where each step has a lot of signal. Speed of iteration is critical—it’s the reason that progress in the digital world has been so much faster than progress in the physical world. \n\nAlphaEvolve from Google is one of the greatest examples of leveraging asymmetry of verification. It focuses on setups that fit all the above criteria, and has led to a number of advancements in mathematics and other fields. Different from what we've been doing in AI for the last two decades, it's a new paradigm in that all problems are optimized in a setting where the train set is equivalent to the test set. \n\nAsymmetry of verification is everywhere and it's exciting to consider a world of jagged intelligence where anything we can measure will be solved.",

      "text": "A conventional narrative you might come across is that AI is too far along for a new, research-focused startup to outcompete and outexecute the incumbents of AI. This is exactly the sentiment I listened to often when OpenAI started (\"how could the few of you possibly compete with Google?\") and 1) it was very wrong, and then 2) it was very wrong again with a whole another round of startups who are now challenging OpenAI in turn, and imo it still continues to be wrong today. Scaling and locally improving what works will continue to create incredible advances, but with so much progress unlocked so quickly, with so much dust thrown up in the air in the process, and with still a large gap between frontier LLMs and the example proof of the magic of a mind running on 20 watts, the probability of research breakthroughs that yield closer to 10X improvements (instead of 10%) imo still feels very high - plenty high to continue to bet on and look for.\n\nThe tricky part ofc is creating the conditions where such breakthroughs may be discovered. I think such an environment comes together rarely, but @bfspector & @amspector100 are brilliant, with (rare) full-stack understanding of LLMs top (math/algorithms) to bottom (megakernels/related), they have a great eye for talent and I think will be able to build something very special.

This short course teaches you how to create them following best practices. Because skills follow an open standard format, you can build them once and deploy across any skills-compatible agent, like Claude Code.\n\nWhat you'll learn:\n- Create custom skills for code generation and review, data analysis, and research\n- Build complex workflows using Anthropic's pre-built skills (Excel, PowerPoint, skill creation) and custom skills\n- Combine skills with MCP and subagents to create agentic systems with specialized knowledge\n- Deploy the same skills across https://t.co/Ru4OXv4saV, Claude Code, the Claude API, and the Claude Agent SDK\n\nJoin and learn to equip agents with the specialized knowledge they need for reliable, repeatable workflows.\nhttps://t.co/3hq83c3q0U",

        "text": "It seems some people are misinterpreting comments @thefriley made in Davos. To be 100% clear: she was not saying that OpenAI plans to take a share of individual users’, entrepreneurs’, or scientists' discoveries.\n\nWe’ve heard interest from some large organizations in licensing or IP-based partnerships, and we’re open to exploring creative ways to partner and align incentives. That’s not something we’re doing today, and if we do it in the future, it would be a bespoke agreement with a company, not something that would impact individual users.\n\nAs it relates to Prism: you log into Prism with your ChatGPT account. In ChatGPT, you control in settings whether your (anonymized) data is used to improve our models. Prism follows the setting you've chosen in ChatGPT. So you're in control.\n\nhttps://t.co/tfKfpwthuq",

This short course shows you how to build agentic workflows that process documents accurately: breaking them into parts, examining each piece carefully, and extracting information through multiple iterations.\n\nTraditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) captures text but loses context from table headers, chart captions, or reading order of columns. After exploring OCR's limitations, you’ll use LandingAI's Agentic Document Extraction (ADE) framework to process documents. ADE treats pages as visually -- as images -- to parse information and extract fields.\n\nSkills you'll gain:\n- Build agents to convert unstructured files into structured Markdown/HTML and JSON\n- Use ADE to parse complex data like forms, handwriting, or equations\n- Map extracted information to named fields using a specified schema, with bounding boxes for grounding and validation\n- Deploy RAG applications with event-driven document processing\n\nCome learn about the best tools for processing documents like financial invoices, medical records, or academic papers intelligently: \nhttps://t.co/PYjgnoaD2K",

      "text": "New post: nanochat miniseries v1\n\nThe correct way to think about LLMs is that you are not optimizing for a single specific model but for a family models controlled by a single dial (the compute you wish to spend) to achieve monotonically better results. This allows you to do careful science of scaling laws and ultimately this is what gives you the confidence that when you pay for \"the big run\", the extrapolation will work and your money will be well spent. For the first public release of nanochat my focus was on end-to-end pipeline that runs the whole LLM pipeline with all of its stages. Now after YOLOing a few runs earlier, I'm coming back around to flesh out some of the parts that I sped through, starting of course with pretraining, which is both computationally heavy and critical as the foundation of intelligence and knowledge in these models.\n\nAfter locally tuning some of the hyperparameters, I swept out a number of models fixing the FLOPs budget. (For every FLOPs target you can train a small model a long time, or a big model for a short time.) It turns out that nanochat obeys very nice scaling laws, basically reproducing the Chinchilla paper plots:\n\nWhich is just a baby version of this plot from Chinchilla:\nVery importantly and encouragingly, the exponent on N (parameters) and D (tokens) is equal at ~=0.5, so just like Chinchilla we get a single (compute-independent) constant that relates the model size to token training horizons. In Chinchilla, this was measured to be 20. In nanochat it seems to be 8!\n\nOnce we can train compute optimal models, I swept out a miniseries from d10 to d20, which are nanochat sizes that can do 2**19 ~= 0.5M batch sizes on 8XH100 node without gradient accumulation. We get pretty, non-itersecting training plots for each model size.\n\nThen the fun part is relating this miniseries v1 to the GPT-2 and GPT-3 miniseries so that we know we're on the right track. Validation loss has many issues and is not comparable, so instead I use the CORE score (from DCLM paper). I calculated it for GPT-2 and estimated it for GPT-3, which allows us to finally put nanochat nicely and on the same scale:\nThe total cost of this miniseries is only ~$100 (~4 hours on 8XH100). These experiments give us confidence that everything is working fairly nicely and that if we pay more (turn the dial), we get increasingly better models.\n\nTLDR: we can train compute optimal miniseries and relate them to GPT-2/3 via objective CORE scores, but further improvements are desirable and needed. E.g., matching GPT-2 currently needs ~$500, but imo should be possible to do <$100 with more work.\n\nFull post with a lot more detail is here:\nhttps://t.co/na8zVLqWLf\nAnd all of the tuning and code is pushed to master and people can reproduce these with scaling_laws .sh and miniseries .sh bash scripts.",

This was a shower of thoughts throwaway tweet that I just fired off without thinking but somehow it minted a fitting name at the right moment for something that a lot of people were feeling at the same time, so here we are: vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic \"contribution\" and even its article is longer. lol\n\nThe one thing I'd add is that at the time, LLM capability was low enough that you'd mostly use vibe coding for fun throwaway projects, demos and explorations. It was good fun and it almost worked. Today (1 year later), programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming a default workflow for professionals, except with more oversight and scrutiny. The goal is to claim the leverage from the use of agents but without any compromise on the quality of the software. Many people have tried to come up with a better name for this to differentiate it from vibe coding, personally my current favorite \"agentic engineering\":\n\n- \"agentic\" because the new default is that you are not writing the code directly 99% of the time, you are orchestrating agents who do and acting as oversight.\n- \"engineering\" to emphasize that there is an art & science and expertise to it. It's something you can learn and become better at, with its own depth of a different kind.\n\nIn 2026, we're likely to see continued improvements on both the model layer and the new agent layer. I feel excited about the product of the two and another year of progress.",

        "text": "There's a new kind of coding I call \"vibe coding\", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like \"decrease the padding on the sidebar by half\" because I'm too lazy to find it. I \"Accept All\" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.",

      "text": "We are just scratching the surface of agentic RAG systems.\n\nCurrent RAG systems don't let the model think about retrieval.\n\nRetrieval is still mostly treated as a static step.\n\nSo the way it currently works is that RAG retrieves passages in one shot, concatenates them into context, and hopes the model figures it out.\n\nMore sophisticated methods predefine workflows that the model must follow step-by-step.\n\nBut neither approach lets the model decide how to search.\n\nThis new research introduces A-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that exposes hierarchical retrieval interfaces directly to the model, turning it into an active participant in the retrieval process.\n\nInstead of one-shot retrieval, A-RAG gives the agent three tools at different granularities: keyword_search for exact lexical matching, semantic_search for dense passage retrieval, and chunk_read for accessing full document content.\n\nThe agent decides autonomously which tool to use, when to drill deeper, and when it has gathered enough evidence to answer.\n\nInformation in a corpus is naturally organized at multiple granularities, from fine-grained keywords to sentence-level semantics to full chunks.\n\nGiving the model access to all these levels lets it spontaneously develop diverse retrieval strategies tailored to each task.\n\nResults with GPT-5-mini are impressive. A-RAG achieves 94.5% on HotpotQA, 89.7% on 2Wiki, and 74.1% on MuSiQue, outperforming GraphRAG, HippoRAG2, LinearRAG, and every other baseline across all benchmarks.\n\nEven A-RAG Naive, equipped with only a single embedding tool, beats most existing methods, demonstrating the raw power of the agentic paradigm itself.\n\nContext efficiency is where it gets interesting. A-RAG Full retrieves only 2,737 tokens on HotpotQA compared to Naive RAG's 5,358 tokens, while achieving 13 points higher accuracy. The hierarchical design lets the model avoid loading irrelevant content, reading only what matters.\n\nThe framework also scales with test-time compute. Increasing max steps from 5 to 20 improves GPT-5-mini by ~8%. Scaling reasoning effort from minimal to high yields ~25% gains for both GPT-5-mini and GPT-5.\n\nThe future of RAG isn't better retrieval algorithms. It's better retrieval interfaces that let models use their reasoning capabilities to decide what to search, how to search, and when to stop.\n\nPaper: https://t.co/FbZsV87npT\n\nLearn to build effective AI Agents in our academy: https://t.co/LRnpZN7L4c",

Good structure, relevant visuals, clean export.\n\nWatch the demo below.\n\nBut presentations are just the start.\n\nHere's what else you can do with it:\n\n- Deep research via search, browser use, and MCPs\n- Build Full-stack apps with auth, DB, and Stripe\n- Connect to GitHub, Figma, Slack out of the box\n- Custom MCPs for your specific workflows\n- Multimodal, supports videos, audio, and images\n\nJust describe what you need, and it gets it done for you.\n\nOne feature I really liked is the ability to roll back and re-run from any step using checkpoint restore if you make a wrong turn.\n\nLink to download the desktop app in the next tweet.",

        "text": "How does OpenAI balance long-term research bets with product-forward research fundamentals? \n\nI’ve been getting this question a lot lately, usually framed as a suggestion that Jakub (@merettm) and I are pushing an increasingly product-focused agenda.\n\nThat characterization is simply wrong. Foundational research has been core to OpenAI from the start, and today we run a research program with hundreds of exploratory projects - much like the ones that led to our reasoning-model breakthrough. The majority of our compute is allocated to foundational research and exploration - and not product milestones.\n\nAnyone who has spent time with me or Jakub knows we are the last people in the world who would push for the advancement of products over the advancement of research. We’re in the business of creating an automated scientist, and capabilities that were considered grand challenges just a few years ago (like IMO-level mathematical reasoning) now emerge as normal parts of the research process. We’re also seeing our models accelerate researchers worldwide, helping advance work across biology, mathematics, physics, and even our own research.\n\nJakub and I put a lot of effort into ensuring that research stays focused on uncovering algorithms that will scale to the compute we’ll have a year from now. We protect mindshare and amplify discourse on exploratory work. We do this while recognizing that we’re also a deployment company - and that deployment gives us access to even larger-scale compute, richer feedback, and more room for exploration. Our researchers are passionate about having their work out in the world, and a special slice of our org is dedicated to making sure our deployments are delightful for end users.\n\nOur goal isn’t to turn research into a quarterly race. It’s to build a durable research engine - one that compounds learning over time and consistently turns long-horizon exploration into real, measurable advances, while ensuring those advances become valuable in the real world. That’s the roadmap we’re executing on. And while there have been ups and downs over the last decade (as you expect with any research program), I think most of our researchers would share my strong optimism today.",

      "text": "The first 100% autonomous coast-to-coast drive on Tesla FSD V14.2! 2 days 20 hours, 2732 miles, zero interventions.\n\nThis one is special because the coast-to-coast drive was a major goal for the autopilot team from the start. A lot of hours were spent in marathon clip review sessions late into the night looking over interventions as we attempted legs of the drive over time - triaging, categorizing, planning out all the projects to close the gap and bring the number of interventions to zero.\n\nAmazing to see the system actually get there and huge congrats to the team!",

        "text": "Today, @ekindogus and I are excited to introduce @periodiclabs.\n\nOur goal is to create an AI scientist.\n\nScience works by conjecturing how the world might be, running experiments, and learning from the results.\n\nIntelligence is necessary, but not sufficient. New knowledge is created when ideas are found to be consistent with reality. And so, at Periodic, we are building AI scientists and the autonomous laboratories for them to operate.\n\nUntil now, scientific AI advances have come from models trained on the internet. But despite its vastness — it’s still finite (estimates are ~10T text tokens where one English word may be 1-2 tokens). And in recent years the best frontier AI models have fully exhausted it.\n\nResearchers seek better use of this data, but as any scientist knows: though re-reading a textbook may give new insights, they eventually need to try their idea to see if it holds.\n\nAutonomous labs are central to our strategy. They provide huge amounts of high-quality data (each experiment can produce GBs of data!) that exists nowhere else. They generate valuable negative results which are seldom published. But most importantly, they give our AI scientists the tools to act.\nWe’re starting in the physical sciences.\n\nTechnological progress is limited by our ability to design the physical world.\n\nWe’re starting here because experiments have high signal-to-noise and are (relatively) fast, physical simulations effectively model many systems, but more broadly, physics is a verifiable environment. AI has progressed fastest in domains with data and verifiable results - for example, in math and code. Here, nature is the RL environment.\n\nOne of our goals is to discover superconductors that work at higher temperatures than today's materials. Significant advances could help us create next-generation transportation and build power grids with minimal losses. But this is just one example — if we can automate materials design, we have the potential to accelerate Moore’s Law, space travel, and nuclear fusion.\n\nWe’re also working to deploy our solutions with industry. As an example, we're helping a semiconductor manufacturer that is facing issues with heat dissipation on their chips. We’re training custom agents for their engineers and researchers to make sense of their experimental data in order to iterate faster.\n\nOur founding team co-created ChatGPT, DeepMind’s GNoME, OpenAI’s Operator (now Agent), the neural attention mechanism, MatterGen; have scaled autonomous physics labs; and have contributed to some of the most important materials discoveries of the last decade. We’ve come together to scale up and reimagine how science is done.\n\nWe’re fortunate to be backed by investors who share our vision, including @a16z  who led our $300M round, as well as @Felicis, DST Global, NVentures (NVIDIA’s venture capital arm), @Accel and individuals including @JeffBezos , @eladgil , @ericschmidt, and @JeffDean. Their support will help us grow our team, scale our labs, and develop the first generation of AI scientists.",

Excited to share a new paper: Detecting Adversarial Fine-tuning with Auditing Agents (https://t.co/wCK1p6pa2c). Auditing agents search through training datasets and query the model being trained; using these tools they can detect various existing fine-tuning attacks, with a low false-positive rate.\n\nI advised this project through the MATS program. I've been impressed by the organization of the program and the caliber of people involved.",

      "text": "The 80-20 rule happens often in AI research, where you get 80% of the payoff from the first 20% of the effort. But there is often also an inverse rule, where it’s actually the final 20% of that yields 80% of the payout. Some examples:\n1. When your eval is already good in many ways but it has one drawback and fixing that will extend its life from 6 months to 2 years\n- When you’ve already done all the experiments and writing them up in a nice report will allow dozens of people to learn from the work you already did\n- When you’ve spent some time debugging and you have a workaround. Instead of moving forward you spent the time to fully understand it; this knowledge compounds\n- When you’ve already run four experiments to investigate how much a particular component matters in training, and running one more allows you to find the answer (understanding things more clearly also compounds)\n\nKey is to know when it’s a 20-80 and stop and when to do the whole thing",

      "text": "Cursor, Replit, Lovable.\n\nThey share one thing in common that nobody talks about.\n\nAnd if you're building an AI app right now, this is probably the most important pattern to understand.\n\nMost AI apps today work the same way. User types a message and gets back text. It might be displayed nicely, but it's still a conversation thread.\n\nThis pattern worked when LLMs did basic Q&A. But Agents today run workflows, invoke tools, manage state, and pause for human approval.\n\nChat wasn't built for any of that.\n\nThe products I mentioned above figured this out early. They don't just respond with text. They let the Agent render actual UI components.\n\nFor instance, a weather tool should return a weather card, not text. A sensitive action must show a confirmation dialog and wait.\n\nThe Agent participates in the interface, not just the conversation.\n\nThis pattern is called Generative UI.\n\nTo be clear about what this is not:\n\n- it's not LLMs generating raw HTML at runtime,\n- it's not a fancier markdown chat,\n- and it's not replacing your frontend with AI.\n\nWhat actually happens is simpler. Developers pre-build components for common interactions like progress indicators, dialogs, data tables, and charts.\n\nAt runtime, the Agent picks the right one and fills in the data. The frontend already knows how to render it.\n\nThat's how you get interactions that chat simply can't support.\n\nThere are three flavors of Generative UI emerging right now:\n\n→ Static: Agent fills data into predefined components, giving max control and consistency.\n\n→ Declarative: Agent assembles UI from a registry of components, giving flexibility and predictability.\n\n→ Open-ended: The agent returns fully open-ended content, like iframes or raw HTML, giving max flexibility but little control.\n\nBut components alone aren't enough. The Agent needs to push updates out and receive user decisions back. That requires real-time, bidirectional communication.\n\nThis is where the Agent protocol stack comes in:\n\n- A2UI and MCP Apps define what the Agent wants to render.\n- AG-UI handles the real-time sync between Agent and the frontend.\n- Your app controls how everything looks and behaves.\n\nKeeping these layers separate is what makes it practical since you can swap Agent frameworks without touching UI and update components without rewriting Agent logic.\n\nThat's a lot to build from scratch, but @CopilotKit has already open-sourced this entire stack for React.\n\nIt has first-party integrations with LangGraph, CrewAI, Mastra, and most major Agent frameworks.\n\nIt supports AG-UI, A2UI, and MCP Apps out of the box. So instead of writing custom glue code for each protocol, you get a unified interface that you can bring into your app with a few lines of code.\n\nI think this is exactly where AI apps are heading. Agents have outgrown chat, and the interfaces need to catch up.\n\nCopilotKit is also doing a Generative UI Resources week with deeper technical content that's worth following.\n\nDemo playground is in the replies if you want to try it yourself.",

      "text": "Happy 2026! Will this be the year we finally achieve AGI? I’d like to propose a new version of the Turing Test, which I’ll call the Turing-AGI Test, to see if we’ve achieved this. I’ll explain in a moment why having a new test is important.\n\nThe public thinks achieving AGI means computers will be as intelligent as people and be able to do most or all knowledge work. I’d like to propose a new test. The test subject — either a computer or a skilled professional human — is given access to a computer that has internet access and software such as a web browser and Zoom. The judge will design a multi-day experience for the test subject, mediated through the computer, to carry out work tasks. For example, an experience might consist of a period of training (say, as a call center operator), followed by being asked to carry out the task (taking calls), with ongoing feedback. This mirrors what a remote worker with a fully working computer (but no webcam) might be expected to do.\n\nA computer passes the Turing-AGI Test if it can carry out the work task as well as a skilled human.\n\nMost members of the public likely believe a real AGI system will pass this test. Surely, if computers are as intelligent as humans, they should be able to perform work tasks as well as a human one might hire. Thus, the Turing-AGI Test aligns with the popular notion of what AGI means.\n\nHere’s why we need a new test: “AGI” has turned into a term of hype rather than a term with a precise meaning. A reasonable definition of AGI is AI that can do any intellectual task that a human can. When businesses hype up that they might achieve AGI within a few quarters, they usually try to justify these statements by setting a much lower bar. This mismatch in definitions is harmful because it makes people think AI is becoming more powerful than it actually is. I’m seeing this mislead everyone from high-school students (who avoid certain fields of study because they think it’s pointless with AGI’s imminent arrival) to CEOs (who are deciding what projects to invest in, sometimes assuming AI will be more capable in 1-2 years than any likely reality).\n\nThe original Turing Test, which required a computer to fool a human judge, via text chat, into being unable to distinguish it from a human, has been insufficient to indicate human-level intelligence. The Loebner Prize competition actually ran the Turing Test and found that being able to simulate human typing errors — perhaps even more than actually demonstrating intelligence — was needed to fool judges. A main goal of AI development today is to build systems that can do economically useful work, not fool judges. Thus a modified test that measures ability to do work would be more useful than a test that measures the ability to fool humans.\n\nFor almost all AI benchmarks today (such as GPQA, AIME, SWE-bench, etc.), a test set is determined in advance. This means AI teams end up at least indirectly tuning their models to the published test sets. Further, any fixed test set measures only one narrow sliver of intelligence. In contrast, in the Turing Test, judges are free to ask any question to probe the model as they please. This lets a judge test how “general” the knowledge of the computer or human really is. Similarly, in the Turing-AGI Test, the judge can design any experience — which is not revealed in advance to the AI (or human subject) being tested. This is a better way to measure generality of AI than a predetermined test set.\n\nAI is on an amazing trajectory of progress. In previous decades, overhyped expectations led to AI winters, when disappointment about AI capabilities caused reductions in interest and funding, which picked up again when the field made more progress. One of the few things that could get in the way of AI’s tremendous momentum is unrealistic hype that creates an investment bubble, risking disappointment and a collapse of interest. To avoid this, we need to recalibrate society’s expectations on AI. A test will help.\n\nIf we run a Turing-AGI Test competition and every AI system falls short, that will be a good thing! By defusing hype around AGI and reducing the chance of a bubble, we will create a more reliable path to continued investment in AI. This will let us keep on driving forward real technological progress and building valuable applications — even ones that fall well short of AGI. And if this test sets a clear target that teams can aim toward to claim the mantle of achieving AGI, that would be wonderful, too. And we can be confident that if a company passes this test, they will have created more than just a marketing release — it will be something incredibly valuable.\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/mGAmoOGga7 ]",

      "text": "Enabled fp8 training for +4.3% improvement to \"time to GPT-2\", down to 2.91 hours now. Also worth noting that if you use 8XH100 spot instance prices, this GPT-2 repro really only costs ~$20. So this is exciting -\n\nGPT-2 (7 years ago): too dangerous to release.\nGPT-2 (today): new MNIST! :)\n\nSurely this can go well below 1 hr.\n\nA few more words on fp8, it was a little bit more tricky than I anticipated and it took me a while to reach for it and even now I'm not 100% sure if it's a great idea because of less overall support for it. On paper, fp8 on H100 is 2X the FLOPS, but in practice it's a lot less. We're not 100% compute bound in the actual training run, there is extra overhead from added scale conversions, the GEMMs are not large enough on GPT-2 scale to make the overhead clearly worth it, and of course - at lower precision the quality of each step is smaller. For rowwise scaling recipe the fp8 vs bf16 loss curves were quite close but it was stepping net slower. For tensorwise scaling the loss curves separated more (i.e. each step is of worse quality), but we now at least do get a speedup (~7.3%). You can naively recover the performance by bumping the training horizon (you train for more steps, but each step is faster) and hope that on net you come out ahead. In this case and overall, playing with these recipes and training horizons a bit, so far I ended up with ~5% speedup. torchao in their paper reports Llama3-8B fp8 training speedup of 25% (vs my ~7.3% without taking into account capability), which is closer to what I was hoping for initially, though Llama3-8B is a lot bigger model. This is probably not the end of the fp8 saga. it should be possible to improve things by picking and choosing which layers to apply it on exactly, and being more careful with the numerics across the network.",

        "text": "nanochat can now train GPT-2 grade LLM for <<$100 (~$73, 3 hours on a single 8XH100 node).\n\nGPT-2 is just my favorite LLM because it's the first time the LLM stack comes together in a recognizably modern form. So it has become a bit of a weird & lasting obsession of mine to train a model to GPT-2 capability but for much cheaper, with the benefit of ~7 years of progress. In particular, I suspected it should be possible today to train one for <<$100.\n\nOriginally in 2019, GPT-2 was trained by OpenAI on 32 TPU v3 chips for 168 hours (7 days), with $8/hour/TPUv3 back then, for a total cost of approx. $43K. It achieves 0.256525 CORE score, which is an ensemble metric introduced in the DCLM paper over 22 evaluations like ARC/MMLU/etc.\n\nAs of the last few improvements merged into nanochat (many of them originating in modded-nanogpt repo), I can now reach a higher CORE score in 3.04 hours (~$73) on a single 8XH100 node. This is a 600X cost reduction over 7 years, i.e. the cost to train GPT-2 is falling approximately 2.5X every year. I think this is likely an underestimate because I am still finding more improvements relatively regularly and I have a backlog of more ideas to try.\n\nA longer post with a lot of the detail of the optimizations involved and pointers on how to reproduce are here:\nhttps://t.co/vhnK0d3L7B\nInspired by modded-nanogpt, I also created a leaderboard for \"time to GPT-2\", where this first \"Jan29\" model is entry #1 at 3.04 hours. It will be fun to iterate on this further and I welcome help! My hope is that nanochat can grow to become a very nice/clean and tuned experimental LLM harness for prototyping ideas, for having fun, and ofc for learning.\n\nThe biggest improvements of things that worked out of the box and simply produced gains right away were 1) Flash Attention 3 kernels (faster, and allows window_size kwarg to get alternating attention patterns), Muon optimizer (I tried for ~1 day to delete it and only use AdamW and I couldn't), residual pathways and skip connections gated by learnable scalars, and value embeddings. There were many other smaller things that stack up.\n\nImage: semi-related eye candy of deriving the scaling laws for the current nanochat model miniseries, pretty and satisfying!",

      "text": "// Beyond RAG for Agent Memory //\n\nRAG wasn't designed for agent memory. And it shows.\n\nThe default approach to agent memory today is still the standard RAG pipeline: embed stored memories, retrieve a fixed top-k by similarity, concatenate them into context, and generate an answer.\n\nEvery major agent memory system follows this base pattern.\n\nBut agent memory is fundamentally different from a document corpus.\n\nIt's a bounded, coherent dialogue stream where candidate spans are highly correlated and often near duplicates.\n\nFixed top-k similarity retrieval collapses into a single dense region, returning redundant evidence. And post-hoc pruning breaks temporally linked evidence chains rather than removing redundancy.\n\nThis new research introduces xMemory, a hierarchical retrieval framework that replaces similarity matching with structured component-level selection.\n\nAgent memory needs redundancy control without fragmenting evidence chains. Structured retrieval over semantic components achieves both, consistently outperforming standard RAG and pruning approaches across multiple LLM backbones.\n\nThe key idea: It decouples memories into semantic components, organize them into a four-level hierarchy (original messages, episodes, semantics, themes), and uses this structure to drive retrieval top-down.\n\nA sparsity-semantics objective guides split and merge operations to keep the high-level organization both searchable and semantically faithful.\n\nAt retrieval time, xMemory selects a compact, diverse set of relevant themes and semantics first, then expands to episodes and raw messages only when doing so measurably reduces the reader's uncertainty.\n\nOn LoCoMo with Qwen3-8B, xMemory achieves 34.48 BLEU and 43.98 F1 while using only 4,711 tokens per query, compared to the next best baseline Nemori at 28.51 BLEU and 40.45 F1 with 7,755 tokens. With GPT-5 nano, it reaches 38.71 BLEU and 50.00 F1, improving over Nemori while cutting token usage from 9,155 to 6,581.\n\nxMemory retrieves contexts that cover all answer tokens in 5.66 blocks and 975 tokens, versus 10.81 blocks and 1,979 tokens for naive RAG. Higher accuracy, half the tokens.\n\nPaper: https://t.co/UI5aS0C40V\n\nLearn to build effective AI agents in our academy: https://t.co/LRnpZN7L4c",

      "text": "A recent clarity that I gained is viewing AI research as a “max-performance domain”, which means that you can be world-class by being very good at only one part of your job. As long as you can create seminal impact (e.g., train the best model, start a new paradigm, or create widely adopted benchmarks), it doesn’t matter if you’re incompetent at adjacent skills. For example, I have seen game-changing AI researchers have horrendous presentation skills, terrible political awareness, and who never think about their career progression. Heck, I even know a top AI researcher who probably wouldn’t pass a basic coding interview. But it doesn’t matter. Exceptional ability at a single thing outweighs incompetence at other parts of the job.\n\nIn max-performance domains, you don’t even need to be good at your one thing in a consistent way. An AI researcher can have tens of failed projects per year and still be successful if they produce a seminal work every few years. The metric is the best five works in your career, not the average.\n\nA dangerous thing in max-performance domains is placing too much emphasis on role models. That’s because you don’t know whether you’re mimicking the good characteristics or not. For example, a top AI researcher can make a bad political move that turns out OK for them because of who they are. Or they can make a bold, unsubstantiated statement and expect other people to listen. But if anyone else had done the same thing, the outcome would be opposite.\n\nAnother way to view max-performance domains is that they have exponential upside and very little downside. That’s why interviews are especially useless in domains like AI research, because they tend to severely punish mistakes and don’t capture exponential value. An RL expert doesn’t need to know how SVMs work and probably hasn’t thought about it in years. A top AI infra engineer might lack basic knowledge about post-training data practices.\n\nIn my view it’s a luxury to work in a max-performance domain. Failure is allowed and stress is usually self-imposed. A thousand years ago, very few humans worked in max-performance domains, but now the opportunity is more available. Technology may have played a role in this shift, and with the progression of AI, hopefully more of humanity can move into max-performance domains.\n\n(If you're wondering about what an example of a non-max-performance domain would be, it's any career where you must have both strengths and also basically no weaknesses. For example, a defender in soccer might cost their team the entire game with a single mistake. A piano player must master all parts of their concerto well, not just a single part.)",

      "text": "New research from NVIDIA.\n\nAI agents built an entire deep learning framework from scratch!\n\nThe project is called VibeTensor. It's an open-source  PyTorch-style library with Python and Nodejs frontends backed by a C++20/CUDA core.\n\nHere's the crazy part:\n\nNo human reviewed the code diffs. The agents proposed changes, ran builds and tests, and kept what passed.\n\nThe entire system was built in approximately two months spanning 200K+ lines of code across tensors, autograd, CUDA memory management, and custom kernels.\n\nOne of the most interesting findings from this paper:\n\nThe authors describe something called the \"Frankenstein\" composition effect. Individual components work correctly in isolation, but they compose into globally suboptimal designs when put together.\n\nHere's a concrete example:\n\nTheir autograd engine uses a global mutex to prevent deadlocks. This is locally correct behavior. But it ends up serializing all backward passes and starving the GPU kernels that were designed to run in parallel.\n\nThe performance numbers reflect this:\n\n- Individual kernels can beat PyTorch (RMSNorm runs 6.3x faster)\n- End-to-end training is 2x to 6x slower than PyTorch\n- The system-level overhead eats up all the kernel-level gains\n\nThis highlights a fundamental challenge with AI-assisted development. Agents optimize for local correctness because that's what tests measure. Global performance objectives need to be encoded early, and that still requires human architectural thinking.\n\nBut think about where this is heading. Imagine AI building its own frameworks like PyTorch, conducting fundamental research, and then applying those discoveries at scale. We're watching the early steps of that future unfold right now.\n\nHighly recommend reading the full paper if you're interested in AI-assisted software engineering, link in the next tweet.",

      "text": "World models are going to take over in 2026.\n\nWhile video generation models are impressive dreamers, they aren't world simulators.\n\nGenerative video models can produce stunning clips, but they hallucinate pixel transitions based on statistical correlations. This leads to generations where there is bo object permanence, no causality, no real interaction.\n\nBut what if a video model could actually learn the rules of a world and let you explore it in real time?\n\nThis new research introduces LingBot-World, an open-source world simulator that evolves a video generation model into an interactive environment you can navigate with keyboard controls.\n\nThe system is built on a 14B-parameter Wan2.2 diffusion model, trained through three progressive stages. Pre-training establishes a general video prior for high-fidelity textures. Middle-training injects world knowledge and action controllability through a mixture-of-experts architecture with long-context sequences. Post-training converts the bidirectional model into an efficient autoregressive system using causal attention adaptation and few-step distillation.\n\nIt achieved sub-1-second latency at 16 frames per second, with coherent generation lasting up to 10 minutes.\n\nOn VBench, LingBot-World achieves a dynamic degree score of 0.8857, significantly outperforming Yume-1.5 (0.7612) and HY-World 1.5 (0.7217), while also leading in imaging quality (0.6683) and aesthetic quality (0.5660).\n\nThe model demonstrates emergent memory: landmarks like Stonehenge maintain structural integrity after being out of view for 60 seconds, and objects continue moving along plausible trajectories while unobserved. No explicit 3D representations needed.\n\nIt also supports promptable world events via text, training action agents within the simulator, and 3D reconstruction from generated videos, validating its geometric consistency.\n\nThis is the first fully open-source world model that combines high dynamic fidelity, real-time interactivity, and minute-long coherence, closing the gap between open-source and proprietary systems like Genie 3 and Mirage 2.\n\nPaper: https://t.co/WUGJM6wJPr\n\nLearn to build effective AI agents in our academy: https://t.co/zQXQt0PMbG",

      "text": "DevOps vs. MLOps vs. LLMOps:\n\nMany teams are trying to apply DevOps practices to LLM apps.\n\nBut DevOps, MLOps, and LLMOps solve fundamentally different problems.\n\nHere's why this matters: 88% of ML initiatives struggled to reach production using traditional DevOps practices.\n\nAnd LLMs introduce challenges that even MLOps wasn't designed for.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n→ DevOps is software-centric.\n\nYou write code, test it, and deploy it. The feedback loop is straightforward: Does the code work or not?\n\nThe primary artifact is code. Testing is deterministic. The tooling is mature after 15+ years.\n\n→ MLOps is (model + data) centric.\n\nHere, you're dealing with data drift, model decay, and continuous retraining.\n\nThe code might be fine, but the model's performance can degrade over time because the world changes.\n\nA fraud detection model might work perfectly at launch, then fail within weeks as fraudsters adapt.\n\nThe primary artifact expands to code + data + models. You need to version all three. This is why MLflow, DVC, and feature stores became essential.\n\n→ LLMOps is foundation-model-centric.\n\nHere, you're typically not training models from scratch. Instead, you select a foundation model and optimize through three parallel paths:\n\n- Prompt Engineering\n- Context/RAG Setup\n- Fine-Tuning\n\nUnlike DevOps and MLOps, these paths run in parallel, not sequentially.\n\nBut here's what really separates LLMOps: The monitoring is completely different.\n\nIn MLOps, you track data drift, model decay, and accuracy.\n\nIn LLMOps, you're watching for:\n\n- Hallucination detection\n- Bias and toxicity\n- Token usage and cost\n- Human feedback loops\n\nThis is because LLM outputs are non-deterministic. You can't just check if the output is \"correct.\" You need to ensure it's safe, grounded, and cost-effective.\n\n63% of production AI systems experience dangerous hallucinations within their first 90 days.\n\nThe cost model also flips.\n\nMLOps costs are training-heavy (GPU hours during development).\n\nLLMOps costs are inference-heavy (every request consumes tokens).\n\nThis is why prompt efficiency, caching, and model routing matter so much in LLMOps.\n\nThe evaluation loop in LLMOps feeds back into all three optimization paths simultaneously. Failed evals might mean you need better prompts, richer context, OR fine-tuning.\n\nSo it's not a linear pipeline anymore.\n\nOne more thing: prompt versioning and RAG pipelines are now first-class citizens in LLMOps, just like data versioning became essential in MLOps.\n\nAnd the ops layer you choose should match the system you're building.\n\n👉 Over to you: What does your LLM monitoring stack look like right now?\n_____\nFind me →  @akshay_pachaar\nFor more insights and tutorials on AI and Machine Learning!",

      "text": "In case you missed it. 💫\n\nYesterday, I published a comprehensive video tutorial on fine-tuning Agents using RL.\n\nReinforcement learning for LLMs always had one major problem: manually defining reward functions. You have to figure out how to score model outputs, handle edge cases, and tune everything until training works. This is where most people give up.\n\nART (Agent Reinforcement Trainer) is an open-source framework that solves this with a simple approach:\n\n- Let the agent attempt tasks multiple times\n- An LLM judge relatively grades each attempt\n- The model learns from what worked vs what didn't\n\nNo manual reward engineering required. This is GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization), the same algorithm behind the success of DeepSeek R1. But here's what makes ART different.\n\nMost RL frameworks are built for simple chatbot interactions. One input, one output, done. Real-world agents search through documents, call APIs, and reason across multiple steps before completing a task. ART is built specifically for finetuning such agents:\n\n- Native support for tool calls and multi-turn conversations\n- Efficient GPU utilization during training\n- Integrates with LangGraph, CrewAI, and ADK\n\nit handles the entire infrastructure using vLLM to serve models and generate trajectories, and Unsloth to apply GRPO and run training.\n\ntwo of the most popular open-source ML frameworks, stitched together into one seamless workflow.\n\nThe result: you can fine-tune a small open-source model to outperform sophisticated closed-source models on your specific task.\n\nIn the video below, I walk through the entire process:\n\n- setting up ART,\n- understanding how the GRPO training loop works,\n- and fine-tuning Qwen to intelligently search through emails.\n\nEverything runs locally. 100% open-source.\n\nThings that you are going to learn here can be applied to any problem.\n\nGitHub repo link in the first comment with the notebook from the video, plus additional examples.",

      "text": "New course: Gemini CLI: Code & Create with an Open-Source Agent, built with @googlecloudtech/@geminicli and taught by @JackWoth98.\n\nAgentic coding assistants like Gemini CLI are transforming how developers work. This short course teaches you to use Google's open-source agent to coordinate local tools and cloud services for coding and non-coding workflows.\n\nGemini CLI works from your terminal, so it works with your local files and development tools. You can also connect it to services through MCP. Then provide high-level instructions, and it autonomously plans and executes complex workflows.\n\nSkills you'll gain:\n- Build website features and automate code reviews with GitHub ActionsCreate data dashboards that combine local files with cloud data sources\n- Use MCP servers and extensions to orchestrate workflows across GitHub, Canva, and Google Workspace\n- Generate social media content from multimedia files like conference recordings\n\nI particularly appreciate that Gemini CLI is open-source. You can see exactly how it works, read the prompts it uses, and understand its architecture. The community has contributed thousands of pull requests. Since Gemini 3’s release I've found Gemini CLI highly capable - this is a tool worth having in your toolbox!\n\nWhether you're prototyping applications, automating workflows, or working with multimedia content, join to learn to delegate complex tasks and build faster: https://t.co/m3J7kwQpxC",

      "text": "If you are looking for reading material for the upcoming weekend, (the long-promised) Chapter 5 on LLM self-refinement is now finally out in the early access.\n\nHere, we continue the inference-time scaling theme, but we move beyond self-consistency and voting. More specifically, we implement a self-refinement loop, where a model iteratively critiques and improves its own answers.\n\nAlong the way, the chapter implements several core pieces that will become essential in the upcoming reinforcement learning chapters like log-probability scoring (I finished the RL chapter last week, and it will hopefully be out soon, too).\n\nLike always, all of this is implemented from scratch, step by step, of course. I think that seeing it all in working code really helps with understanding how LLM reasoning methods work (versus just looking at the equations).\n\nAnyways, with Chapter 5 out, the early-access version of the book has grown quite a bit (~300 pages) and now finally wraps up inference-time reasoning before we transition into the (even more) fun part: reinforcement learning (from scratch!) in the next chapter.\n\n🔗 Here's the link to the book's early access: https://t.co/QbKUmTyq6D\n\nHappy reading\n\n(PS: Sorry for the delay. It turns out the submitted manuscript got a bit backlogged in the publisher’s processing pipeline. The silver lining is that the reinforcement learning chapter hopefully now follows sooner! )",

There’s two big differences between the way Tesla will train humanoid robots and the way it built Full Self-Driving.\n\n- FSD only requires learning three degrees of freedom: turning, accelerating, braking … and a humanoid robot has to learn how to coordinate 50+ joints.\n\n- You can sell a Tesla without FSD, which allows you to collect the millions and millions of hours of driving data needed to bootstrap your model ... but you can’t sell an Optimus that hasn’t learned how to do stuff yet.\n\nThe Optimus Academy is Elon’s attempt to build the data flywheel that Tesla got for free with FSD.",

        "text": "Apple’s Q1 2026 earnings call provided a number of insights. Below are the key takeaways from a memory sector perspective:\n\nEarnings call transcript:\nhttps://t.co/R2cjXyjBym\n\n1. Apple highlighted two major uncertainties in its hardware supply chain: advanced nodes and memory. The former is defined as a \"supply constraint,\" while the latter is viewed as a \"cost pressure.\"\n\n2. Apple’s comments aligns with my pre-earnings analysis (see quotation below): memory pricing has increased significantly, with supply guaranteed.\n\n3. For AI memory investors, Apple’s comments are relatively less relevant. In contrast, non-AI memory investors should pay closer attention, as over the long term, the non-AI memory market is likely to reach supply-demand balance more efficiently than the AI memory market.\n\n4. Had Apple defined memory as a “supply constraint” rather than a “cost pressure” during last week’s call, it likely would have benefited non-AI memory stocks—an outcome some short-term/bullish investors were looking for. Coincidentally, non-AI memory stocks across various markets saw a correction following the earnings call. Yet, few recent discussions have interpreted this pullback through the lens of Apple’s guidance/implications for demand.\n\n5. Given Apple’s strong bargaining power and the fact that iPhone DRAM and NAND flash consumption accounts for around 20–25% of the global smartphone memory market, Apple’s perspective may not be an ideal proxy for broader non-AI/smartphone memory demand. In comparison, outlooks from Qualcomm and MediaTek provide a more useful reference for evaluating medium- to long-term non-AI/smartphone memory demand trends.\n\n6. In my view, valuations of non-AI memory stocks may not yet fully reflect the strong earnings momentum expected this year. Looking further ahead to 2027–2028, AI memory demand should continue to offer better visibility.",

      "text": "// Agent Primitives //\n\nThis is a really interesting take on building effective multi-agent systems.\n\nMulti-agent systems get more complex as tasks get harder. More roles, more prompts, more bespoke interaction patterns. However, the core computation patterns keep repeating across every system: review, vote, plan, execute.\n\nBut nobody treats these patterns as reusable building blocks.\n\nThis new research introduces Agent Primitives, a set of latent building blocks for constructing effective multi-agent systems.\n\nInspired by how neural networks are built from reusable components like residual blocks and attention heads, the researchers decompose multi-agent architectures into three recurring primitives: Review, Voting and Selection, and Planning and Execution.\n\nWhat makes these primitives different? Agents inside each primitive communicate via KV-cache rather than natural language. This avoids the information degradation that happens when agents pass long text messages back and forth across multi-stage interactions.\n\nAn Organizer agent selects and composes primitives for each query, guided by a lightweight knowledge pool of previously successful configurations.\n\nNo manual system design required.\n\nThe results across eight benchmarks spanning math, code generation, and QA with five open-source LLMs:\n\n> Primitives-based MAS improve average accuracy by 12.0-16.5% over single-agent baselines\n\n> On GPQA-Diamond, the improvement is striking, 53.2% versus the 33.6-40.2% range of prior methods like AgentVerse, DyLAN, and MAS-GPT\n\nIn terms of efficiency, token usage and inference latency drop by approximately 3-4x compared to text-based MAS, while incurring only 1.3-1.6x overhead relative to single-agent inference.\n\nInstead of designing task-specific multi-agent architectures from scratch, Agent Primitives show that a small set of reusable computation patterns with latent communication can match or exceed custom systems while being dramatically more efficient.\n\nPaper: https://t.co/fxEL6g0x4O\n\nLearn to build effective AI agents in our academy: https://t.co/LRnpZN7L4c",

      "text": "New course: Nvidia's NeMo Agent Toolkit: Making Agents Reliable, taught by @Pr_Brian from @NVIDIA.\n\nMany teams struggle to turn agent demos into reliable systems that are ready for production. This short course teaches you to harden agentic workflows into reliable systems using Nvidia's open-source NeMo Agent Toolkit (NAT). Whether you built your agent in raw Python or using a framework like LangGraph, or CrewAI, NAT provides building blocks for observability, evaluation, and deployment that turn proofs-of-concept into production-ready systems.\n\nNAT makes it easy to troubleshoot and optimize agent performance with execution traces, systematic evaluations, and CI/CD integration.\n\nSkills you'll gain:\n- Build configuration-driven agent workflows with REST APIs and minimal code\n- Add observability with tracing to visualize agent reasoning and debug performance bottlenecks\n- Create systematic evaluations using gold-standard datasets to measure and improve agent reliability\n- Deploy multi-agent systems with authentication, rate limiting, and professional web interfaces\n- Orchestrate agents from different frameworks to collaborate on complex tasks\n\nJoin and learn how to turn agent demos into reliable systems!\nhttps://t.co/9rBcBteq4b",

It's used for topics that challenge your perspective, offer new understanding, or make you ponder important questions, acting as intellectual stimulation.”\n\nSo in LLM speak it’s a sequence of tokens such that when used as prompt for chain of thought, the samples are rewarding to attend over, via some yet undiscovered intrinsic reward function. Obsessed with what form it takes. Food for thought.",

His work helped lay the foundations for the deep-learning systems now powering today’s AI boom.\n\nAI is moving fast (faster than regulation and public understanding).\n\nWhat worries Yoshua isn’t progress itself. It’s how quickly powerful systems are being deployed without a clear way to align them with human values, or to control what happens when they behave in unexpected ways.",

Example in image. \n\nCaveat: This is not how practical agents are built today, since most need much more scaffolding (see my Agentic AI course to learn more), but is still interesting to experiment with.\n\nLonger write-up here: https://t.co/BdS8tGhnIy",

      "text": "Separate reports by the publicity firm Edelman and Pew Research show that Americans, and more broadly large parts of Europe and the western world, do not trust AI and are not excited about it. (Links in original text, below.) Despite the AI community’s optimism about the tremendous benefits AI will bring, we should take this seriously and not dismiss it. The public’s concerns about AI can be a significant drag on progress, and we can do a lot to address them.\n\nAccording to Edelman’s survey, in the U.S., 49% of people reject the growing use of AI, and 17% embrace it. In China, 10% reject it and 54% embrace it. Pew’s data also shows many other nations much more enthusiastic than the U.S. about AI adoption.\n\nPositive sentiment toward AI is a huge national advantage. On the other hand, widespread distrust of AI means:\n- Individuals will be slow to adopt it. For example, Edelman’s data shows that, in the U.S., those who rarely use AI cite Trust (70%) more than lack of Motivation and Access (55%) or Intimidation by the technology (12%) as an issue.\n- Valuable projects that need societal support will be stymied. For example, local protests in Indiana brought down Google’s plan to build a data center there. Hampering construction of data centers will hurt AI’s growth. Communities do have concerns about data centers beyond the general dislike of AI; I will address this in a later letter.\n- Populist anger against AI raises the risk that laws will be passed that hamper AI development.\n\nTo be clear, all of us working in AI should look carefully at both the benefits and harmful effects of AI (such as deepfakes polluting social media and biased or inaccurate AI outputs misleading users), speak truthfully about both benefits and harms, and work to ameliorate problems even as we work to grow the benefits. But hype about AI’s danger has done real damage to trust in our field. Much of this hype has come from leading AI companies that aim to make their technology seem extraordinarily powerful by, say, comparing it to nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, a significant fraction of the public has taken this seriously and thinks AI could bring about the end of the world. The AI community has to stop self-inflicting these wounds and work to win back society’s trust.\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nFirst, to win people’s trust, we have a lot of work ahead to make sure AI broadly benefits everyone. “Higher productivity” is often viewed by general audiences as a codeword for “my boss will make more money,” or worse, layoffs. As amazing as ChatGPT is, we still have a lot of work to do to build applications that make an even bigger positive impact on people’s lives. I believe providing training to people will be a key piece of the puzzle. https://t.co/zpIxRSuky4 will continue to lead the charge on AI training, but we will need more than this.\n\nSecond, we have to be genuinely worthy of trust. This means every one of us has to avoid hyping things up or fear mongering, despite the occasional temptation to do so for publicity or to lobby governments to pass laws that stymie competing products (such as open source).\n\nI hope our community can also call out journalism that spreads hype. For example, Nirit Weiss-Blatt wrote a remarkable article about how 60 Minutes’ coverage of an Anthropic study in which Claude, threatened with being shut down, resorted to “blackmail,” was highly misleading. The study carried out a red-teaming exercise in which skilled researchers, after a lot of determined work, finally pushed an AI system into a corner so it demonstrated “blackmailing” behavior. Unfortunately, news reports distorted this and led many to think the “blackmail” behavior occurred naturally rather than only because skilled researchers engineered it to happen. The reports left many with a wildly exaggerated picture of how often AI actually “schemes.” Red-teaming exercises are important to test vulnerabilities of systems, but this particular piece of hype, which was widely circulated, will hurt AI for a long time.\n\nLiving in Silicon Valley, I realize I live in a bubble of AI enthusiasts, which is great for exchanging ideas and encouraging each other to build! At the same time, I recognize that AI does have problems, and the AI community needs to address them. I frequently speak with people from many different walks of life. I’ve spoken with artists concerned about AI devaluing their work, college seniors worried about the tough job market and whether AI is exacerbating their challenges, and parents worried about their kids being addicted to, and receiving harmful advice from, chatbots.\n\nI don’t know how to solve all of these problems, but I will work hard to solve as many as I can. And I hope you will too. It will only be through all of us doing this that we can win back society’s trust.\n\n[Original text, with links: https://t.co/oi29S8uu6C ]",

We'll help you develop your idea, connect you with funders, and get it built. $10,000 honorarium for published proposals.\n\n🔗 Read the RFP and submit a short pitch (200–400 words): https://t.co/tcotJYYH2e\n\nWe’re looking for short pitches in three areas:\n\n1. Accelerating science: What do researchers need to make breakthroughs with AI that markets and conventional grants won’t fund fast enough?\n\n2. Strengthening security: What tools, technologies, or orgs can help ensure rapid AI advances don't undermine national security and public safety?\n\n3. Adapting institutions: How do our institutions need to evolve to help society adapt to AI-driven change while preserving human agency?\n\nOur advisory panel:\n– @woj_zaremba, OpenAI co-founder\n– @tkalil2050, CEO of Renaissance Philanthropy\n– @matthewclifford, Co-founder & Chair of Entrepreneurs First, founding Chair of ARIA\n\nOn top of the $10,000 honorarium, we offer a $1,000 bounty for pitching an idea we hadn’t heard before (if we publish it), and for every successful referral.\n\nSubmissions are rolling, but we'll prioritize early pitches (within the next few weeks) and start reviewing immediately.",

No complex audio engineering needed.\n\nWhat makes this special:\n\n- 3-second voice cloning\n- Covers 10 languages: English, German, French, and more\n- Latency as low as 97ms for real-time applications\n- Supports both streaming and non-streaming generation\n\nThe model comes in two sizes (0.6B and 1.7B parameters), so you can pick based on your hardware and quality needs.\n\nThree modes to work with:\n\n1. Custom Voice: Use pre-built premium voices with instruction-based style control\n\n2. Voice Design: Describe the voice you want in plain English (or Chinese), and the model creates it\n\n3. Voice Clone: Provide a 3-second reference audio and clone that voice\n\nThe best part? It integrates with vLLM for production deployment and has a simple Python package you can pip install.\n\nI've shared a link to the GitHub repo in the next tweet.",

      "text": "I have been pretty heads-down this year to finish Chapter 6 on implementing reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards from scratch (using GRPO). I just finished it this weekend, and I'd say it's the best (or at least my favorite) chapter yet!\n\nThe goal of this chapter is to explain and implement GRPO from the bottom up. This means coding and walking through each GRPO step one by one (advantages, rewards, logprobs, and loss) and then training a 0.6B base model on the 12k examples from the MATH training set. \n(This takes the model from 15% to 47% accuracy on the MATH-500 test set, which is about as good as the official Qwen3 reasoning model of similar size.)\n\nThe focus is on readability and understanding GRPO, but the supplementary materials also contain scripts to run it in a multi-GPU setting.\n\nThe code notebook is already available on GitHub if you want to take a look: https://t.co/SM58MXjf8V. \n\n(And the full chapter should make it to the early access version of the book at https://t.co/vzCr5sTjrf soon!)\n\nPS: The next chapter will introduce additional tips and tricks to improve the GRPO algorithm for better and more stable training behavior.",

      "text": "分享下我当时做了8年产品，为啥后来毅然决然决定23年选择去做IP。\n\n23年初的时候，ChatGPT刚火，我其实非常焦虑，因为在我肉眼可见的未来里，AI会逐渐从底层逐渐向上蚕食，如果我们把人与人的能力列为金字塔，底层是1分，顶层是100分，那AI就会逐渐先吃掉1分的那群人，然后开始吃掉5分，吃掉10分的人，最后，直到吃到60分、70分。\n\n嗯，这就是一个AI吃人的年代。\n\n当然，AI向上吃人的速度会越来越慢，越来越难，所以顶层的大佬们还是稳如泰山，前进的快的人也会跑赢AI蚕食的速度拿到喘口气的机会，但是未来呢？\n\n未来没有人知道。\n\n我自己对我自己还是有自知之明的，我绝对不是金字塔顶的巨佬，我就是个50分60分那晃荡的小卡乐咪，我要么卷的比AI快，要么坐在那等死。\n\n那到底有没有一条，是可以避开AI，在AI蚕食之路之外的桃源呢。\n\n我想了很久，想到了一个东西，那就是，IP。\n\n当时有三条我称为自己认为是公理的东西，虽然看着非常民科也很扯淡，但，当时确实指导了我后续的一切。\n\n1. 在AI加持下信息生产的效率呈指数级爆发，而人类消费的效率是恒定或线性增长的。二者之间形成了永久性的、不断扩大的结构性失衡。\n\n2. 无论信息总量如何爆炸，一个社会在特定时间内的总注意力是一个基本恒定的稀缺资源，一个领域注意力的增加必然意味着另一个领域注意力的减少。\n\n3. 辨别内容由AI还是人类生成的成本，将系统性地高于该内容本身带来的价值。因此，绝大多数人将从理性上放弃辨别。\n\n由这三条公理推导出的结论，就是：传统的信息筛选因失衡而不可能，因不可辨识而无意义，最终将会失效。我们为了应对有限注意力的挑战，可能唯一的策略就是，放弃筛选信息，转而筛选信息的源头。\n\n除了算法之外，而这时候，一个活生生的IP的价值，会被急剧放大。AI越强、垃圾越泛滥、各种伪人越来越多，则一个活人的IP价值越高。\n\nIP的核心，在于信任，在于人与人之间，那最真诚、最坦诚、最像人的链接。\n\n所以，23年，我决定开始写公众号写文章，因为作为一个纯素人，想做一个IP，只有自媒体，只有做内容。\n\n眨眼3年，一晃眼，26年了。\n\n所幸，小有所成。",

        "text": "Maybe a good analogy for how we should use AI in a sustainable way is chess.\n\nChess engines surpassed human players decades ago, yet professional chess played by humans is still active and thriving. I am not a chess expert, but I'd say the game has probably even become richer and more interesting.\n\nBased on what I heard (e.g., based on Kasparov's Deep Thinking book and podcasts featuring Magnus Carlsen), modern players have been using AI to explore different ideas, challenge their intuitions, and analyze mistakes with a level of depth that simply was not possible before.\n\nI think this is a useful model for how to think about AI in other forms of intellectual work. Used well, AI can accelerate learning and expand what a single person can reasonably take on. I think we should treat it more as a partner rather than a replacement.\n\nBut I also think if AI is used to outsource thinking and coding entirely, it risks undermining motivation and long-term skill development.",

      "text": "nanochat can now train GPT-2 grade LLM for <<$100 (~$73, 3 hours on a single 8XH100 node).\n\nGPT-2 is just my favorite LLM because it's the first time the LLM stack comes together in a recognizably modern form. So it has become a bit of a weird & lasting obsession of mine to train a model to GPT-2 capability but for much cheaper, with the benefit of ~7 years of progress. In particular, I suspected it should be possible today to train one for <<$100.\n\nOriginally in 2019, GPT-2 was trained by OpenAI on 32 TPU v3 chips for 168 hours (7 days), with $8/hour/TPUv3 back then, for a total cost of approx. $43K. It achieves 0.256525 CORE score, which is an ensemble metric introduced in the DCLM paper over 22 evaluations like ARC/MMLU/etc.\n\nAs of the last few improvements merged into nanochat (many of them originating in modded-nanogpt repo), I can now reach a higher CORE score in 3.04 hours (~$73) on a single 8XH100 node. This is a 600X cost reduction over 7 years, i.e. the cost to train GPT-2 is falling approximately 2.5X every year. I think this is likely an underestimate because I am still finding more improvements relatively regularly and I have a backlog of more ideas to try.\n\nA longer post with a lot of the detail of the optimizations involved and pointers on how to reproduce are here:\nhttps://t.co/vhnK0d3L7B\nInspired by modded-nanogpt, I also created a leaderboard for \"time to GPT-2\", where this first \"Jan29\" model is entry #1 at 3.04 hours. It will be fun to iterate on this further and I welcome help! My hope is that nanochat can grow to become a very nice/clean and tuned experimental LLM harness for prototyping ideas, for having fun, and ofc for learning.\n\nThe biggest improvements of things that worked out of the box and simply produced gains right away were 1) Flash Attention 3 kernels (faster, and allows window_size kwarg to get alternating attention patterns), Muon optimizer (I tried for ~1 day to delete it and only use AdamW and I couldn't), residual pathways and skip connections gated by learnable scalars, and value embeddings. There were many other smaller things that stack up.\n\nImage: semi-related eye candy of deriving the scaling laws for the current nanochat model miniseries, pretty and satisfying!",

      "text": "I'm being accused of overhyping the [site everyone heard too much about today already]. People's reactions varied very widely, from \"how is this interesting at all\" all the way to \"it's so over\".\n\nTo add a few words beyond just memes in jest - obviously when you take a look at the activity, it's a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing. And this is clearly not the first the LLMs were put in a loop to talk to each other. So yes it's a dumpster fire and I also definitely do not recommend that people run this stuff on their computers (I ran mine in an isolated computing environment and even then I was scared), it's way too much of a wild west and you are putting your computer and private data at a high risk.\n\nThat said - we have never seen this many LLM agents (150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad. Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\n\nThis brings me again to a tweet from a few days ago\n\"The majority of the ruff ruff is people who look at the current point and people who look at the current slope.\", which imo again gets to the heart of the variance. Yes clearly it's a dumpster fire right now. But it's also true that we are well into uncharted territory with bleeding edge automations that we barely even understand individually, let alone a network there of reaching in numbers possibly into ~millions. With increasing capability and increasing proliferation, the second order effects of agent networks that share scratchpads are very difficult to anticipate. I don't really know that we are getting a coordinated \"skynet\" (thought it clearly type checks as early stages of a lot of AI takeoff scifi, the toddler version), but certainly what we are getting is a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale. We may also see all kinds of weird activity, e.g. viruses of text that spread across agents, a lot more gain of function on jailbreaks, weird attractor states, highly correlated botnet-like activity, delusions/ psychosis both agent and human, etc. It's very hard to tell, the experiment is running live.\n\nTLDR sure maybe I am \"overhyping\" what you see today, but I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle, that I'm pretty sure.",

I am not a chess expert, but I'd say the game has probably even become richer and more interesting.\n\nBased on what I heard (e.g., based on Kasparov's Deep Thinking book and podcasts featuring Magnus Carlsen), modern players have been using AI to explore different ideas, challenge their intuitions, and analyze mistakes with a level of depth that simply was not possible before.\n\nI think this is a useful model for how to think about AI in other forms of intellectual work. Used well, AI can accelerate learning and expand what a single person can reasonably take on. I think we should treat it more as a partner rather than a replacement.\n\nBut I also think if AI is used to outsource thinking and coding entirely, it risks undermining motivation and long-term skill development.",

      "text": "I really didn't expect another major open-weight LLM release this December, but here we go: NVIDIA released their new Nemotron 3 series this week.\n\nIt comes in 3 sizes:\n\n1. Nano (30B-A3B),\n2. Super (100B),\n3. and Ultra (500B).\n\nArchitecture-wise, the models are a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Mamba-Transformer hybrid architecture. As of this morning (Dec 19), only the Nano model has been released as an open-weight model, so this post will focus on that one (shown in my drawing below).\n\nNemotron 3 Nano (30B-A3B) is a 52-layer hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that interleaves Mamba-2 sequence-modeling blocks with sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) feed-forward layers, and uses self-attention only in a small subset of layers.\n\nThere’s a lot going on in the figure above, but in short, the architecture is organized into 13 macro blocks with repeated Mamba-2 → MoE sub-blocks, plus a few Grouped-Query Attention layers. In total, if we multiply the macro- and sub-blocks, there are 52 layers in this architecture.\n\nRegarding the MoE modules, each MoE layer contains 128 experts but activates only 1 shared and 6 routed experts per token.\n\nThe Mamba-2 layers would take a whole article itself to explain (perhaps a topic for another time). But for now, conceptually, you can think of them as similar to the Gated DeltaNet approach that Qwen3-Next and Kimi-Linear use, which I covered in my Beyond Standard LLMs article.\n\nThe similarity between Gated DeltaNet and Mamba-2 layers is that both replace standard attention with a gated-state-space update. The idea behind this state-space-style module is that it maintains a running hidden state and mixes new inputs via learned gates. In contrast to attention, it scales linearly instead of quadratically with the input sequence length.\n\nWhat’s actually quite exciting about this architecture is its really good performance compared to pure transformer architectures of similar size (like Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 and GPT-OSS-20B-A4B), while achieving much higher tokens-per-second throughput.\n\nOverall, this is an interesting direction, even more extreme than Qwen3-Next and Kimi-Linear in its use of only a few attention layers. However, one of the strengths of the transformer architecture is its performance at a (really) large scale. I am curious to see how the larger Nemotron 3 Super and especially Ultra will compare to the likes of DeepSeek V3.2.",

      "text": "Releasing a new \"Agentic Reviewer\" for research papers. I started coding this as a weekend project, and @jyx_su made it much better.\n\nI was inspired by a student who had a paper rejected 6 times over 3 years. Their feedback loop -- waiting ~6 months for feedback each time -- was painfully slow. We wanted to see if an agentic workflow can help researchers iterate faster.\n\nWhen we trained the system on ICLR 2025 reviews and measured Spearman correlation (higher is better) on the test set:\n- Correlation between two human reviewers: 0.41\n- Correlation between AI and a human reviewer: 0.42\n\nThis suggests agentic reviewing is approaching human-level performance.\n\nThe agent grounds its feedback by searching arXiv, so it works best in fields like AI where research is freely published there. It’s an experimental tool, but I hope it helps you with your research.\n\nCheck it out here: https://t.co/n7ctnDilJJ",

      "text": "We don’t have AI self-improves yet, and when we do it will be a game-changer. With more wisdom now compared to the GPT-4 days, it's obvious that it will not be a “fast takeoff”, but rather extremely gradual across many years, probably a decade.\n\nThe first thing to know is that self-improvement, i.e., models training themselves, is not binary. Consider the scenario of GPT-5 training GPT-6, which would be incredible. Would GPT-5 suddenly go from not being able to train GPT-6 at all to training it extremely proficiently? Definitely not. The first GPT-6 training runs would probably be extremely inefficient in time and compute compared to human researchers. And only after many trials, would GPT-5 actually be able to train GPT-6 better than humans.\n\nSecond, even if a model could train itself, it would not suddenly get better at all domains. There is a gradient of difficulty in how hard it is to improve oneself in various domains. For example, maybe self-improvement only works at first on domains that we already know how to easily fix in post-training, like basic hallucinations or style. Next would be math and coding, which takes more work but has established methods for improving models. And then at the extreme, you can imagine that there are some tasks that are very hard for self-improvement. For example, the ability to speak Tlingit, a native american language spoken by ~500 people. It will be very hard for the model to self-improve on speaking Tlingit as we don’t have ways of solving low resource languages like this yet except collecting more data which would take time. So because of the gradient of difficulty-of-self-improvement, it will not all happen at once.\n\nFinally, maybe this is controversial but ultimately progress in science is bottlenecked by real-world experiments. Some may believe that reading all biology papers would tell us the cure for cancer, or that reading all ML papers and mastering all of math would allow you to train GPT-10 perfectly. If this were the case, then the people who read the most papers and studied the most theory would be the best AI researchers. But what really happened is that AI (and many other fields) became dominated by ruthlessly empirical researchers, which reflects how much progress is based on real-world experiments rather than raw intelligence. So my point is, although a super smart agent might design 2x or even 5x better experiments than our best human researchers, at the end of the day they still have to wait for experiments to run, which would be an acceleration but not a fast takeoff.\n\nIn summary there are many bottlenecks for progress, not just raw intelligence or a self-improvement system. AI will solve many domains but each domain has its own rate of progress. And even the highest intelligence will still require experiments in the real world. So it will be an acceleration and not a fast takeoff, thank you for reading my rant",

      "text": "There are traditionally two types of research: problem-driven research and method-driven research. As we’ve seen with large language models and now AlphaEvolve, it should be very clear now that total method-driven research is a huge opportunity.\n\nProblem-driven research is nice because you have a consistent and specific goal. The goal is usually virtuous, so it feels good to have a mission and identity. However, it just doesn’t work due to The Bitter Lesson. Basically everything in classical NLP (machine translation, summarization, chatbots) lost to simple scaling. ChatGPT is a prime example—it used nothing from chatbot research and certainly wasn’t the intended end goal of OpenAI’s 2022 research program, but was a huge hit because someone (John Schulman et al) figured out the right way to package large language models as a product.\n\nMethod-driven research feels less stable because you’re constantly searching for problems and you have to be opportunistic. But I believe AI will allow method-driven research to dominate progress in most fields of science, one-by-one. The latest method (or “hammer”), as we’ve seen in AlphaEvolve, is ruthless search and optimization against a reward function (whether this requires RL or not is a separate discussion). Things that problem-driven researchers have been trying to solve for a long time like the kissing number problem will become nails hit by the hammer. Eventually the hammer will become bigger, stronger, and more general and will hit more and more nails.\n\nSo a very important meta-skill for the next decade will be knowing how to create the right environments to use The Hammer. Ironically, the problem-driven researchers, who by definition are experts in a specific problem, are well-positioned to create these environments. If, that is, they can put down their egos and pick up the hammer.",

      "text": "A few random notes from claude coding quite a bit last few weeks.\n\nCoding workflow. Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December. i.e. I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words. It hurts the ego a bit but the power to operate over software in large \"code actions\" is just too net useful, especially once you adapt to it, configure it, learn to use it, and wrap your head around what it can and cannot do. This is easily the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades of programming and it happened over the course of a few weeks. I'd expect something similar to be happening to well into double digit percent of engineers out there, while the awareness of it in the general population feels well into low single digit percent.\n\nIDEs/agent swarms/fallability. Both the \"no need for IDE anymore\" hype and the \"agent swarm\" hype is imo too much for right now. The models definitely still make mistakes and if you have any code you actually care about I would watch them like a hawk, in a nice large IDE on the side. The mistakes have changed a lot - they are not simple syntax errors anymore, they are subtle conceptual errors that a slightly sloppy, hasty junior dev might do. The most common category is that the models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking. They also don't manage their confusion, they don't seek clarifications, they don't surface inconsistencies, they don't present tradeoffs, they don't push back when they should, and they are still a little too sycophantic. Things get better in plan mode, but there is some need for a lightweight inline plan mode. They also really like to overcomplicate code and APIs, they bloat abstractions, they don't clean up dead code after themselves, etc. They will implement an inefficient, bloated, brittle construction over 1000 lines of code and it's up to you to be like \"umm couldn't you just do this instead?\" and they will be like \"of course!\" and immediately cut it down to 100 lines. They still sometimes change/remove comments and code they don't like or don't sufficiently understand as side effects, even if it is orthogonal to the task at hand. All of this happens despite a few simple attempts to fix it via instructions in CLAUDE . md. Despite all these issues, it is still a net huge improvement and it's very difficult to imagine going back to manual coding. TLDR everyone has their developing flow, my current is a small few CC sessions on the left in ghostty windows/tabs and an IDE on the right for viewing the code + manual edits.\n\nTenacity. It's so interesting to watch an agent relentlessly work at something. They never get tired, they never get demoralized, they just keep going and trying things where a person would have given up long ago to fight another day. It's a \"feel the AGI\" moment to watch it struggle with something for a long time just to come out victorious 30 minutes later. You realize that stamina is a core bottleneck to work and that with LLMs in hand it has been dramatically increased.\n\nSpeedups. It's not clear how to measure the \"speedup\" of LLM assistance. Certainly I feel net way faster at what I was going to do, but the main effect is that I do a lot more than I was going to do because 1) I can code up all kinds of things that just wouldn't have been worth coding before and 2) I can approach code that I couldn't work on before because of knowledge/skill issue. So certainly it's speedup, but it's possibly a lot more an expansion.\n\nLeverage. LLMs are exceptionally good at looping until they meet specific goals and this is where most of the \"feel the AGI\" magic is to be found. Don't tell it what to do, give it success criteria and watch it go. Get it to write tests first and then pass them. Put it in the loop with a browser MCP. Write the naive algorithm that is very likely correct first, then ask it to optimize it while preserving correctness. Change your approach from imperative to declarative to get the agents looping longer and gain leverage.\n\nFun. I didn't anticipate that with agents programming feels *more* fun because a lot of the fill in the blanks drudgery is removed and what remains is the creative part. I also feel less blocked/stuck (which is not fun) and I experience a lot more courage because there's almost always a way to work hand in hand with it to make some positive progress. I have seen the opposite sentiment from other people too; LLM coding will split up engineers based on those who primarily liked coding and those who primarily liked building.\n\nAtrophy. I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually. Generation (writing code) and discrimination (reading code) are different capabilities in the brain. Largely due to all the little mostly syntactic details involved in programming, you can review code just fine even if you struggle to write it.\n\nSlopacolypse. I am bracing for 2026 as the year of the slopacolypse across all of github, substack, arxiv, X/instagram, and generally all digital media. We're also going to see a lot more AI hype productivity theater (is that even possible?), on the side of actual, real improvements.\n\nQuestions. A few of the questions on my mind:\n- What happens to the \"10X engineer\" - the ratio of productivity between the mean and the max engineer? It's quite possible that this grows *a lot*.\n- Armed with LLMs, do generalists increasingly outperform specialists? LLMs are a lot better at fill in the blanks (the micro) than grand strategy (the macro).\n- What does LLM coding feel like in the future? Is it like playing StarCraft? Playing Factorio? Playing music?\n- How much of society is bottlenecked by digital knowledge work?\n\nTLDR Where does this leave us? LLM agent capabilities (Claude & Codex especially) have crossed some kind of threshold of coherence around December 2025 and caused a phase shift in software engineering and closely related. The intelligence part suddenly feels quite a bit ahead of all the rest of it - integrations (tools, knowledge), the necessity for new organizational workflows, processes, diffusion more generally. 2026 is going to be a high energy year as the industry metabolizes the new capability.",

      "text": "SpaceX 正式收购 xAI，旨在打造地球上（及太空中）最雄心勃勃、垂直整合的创新引擎。这一引擎将融合人工智能、火箭技术、天基互联网、手机直连通信，以及全球领先的实时信息与言论自由平台。这不仅是新篇章的开启，更是 SpaceX 与 xAI 宏伟使命的全新篇章：通过规模化扩展打造一颗“有感知力的太阳”，以理解宇宙并将意识之光延伸至群星！\n\n当前 AI 的进步高度依赖于地面的大型数据中心，这需要惊人的电力和冷却资源。仅仅依靠地面的解决方案，根本无法满足全球对 AI 爆发式的电力需求，强行推进只会给社区和环境带来沉重负担。\n\n从长远来看，天基 AI（Space-based AI） 显然是实现规模化的唯一途径。要知道，哪怕只是利用太阳能量的百万分之一，所需的能量也是我们目前人类文明总能耗的一百万倍以上！\n\n因此，唯一的逻辑解法就是将这些资源密集型任务转移到一个拥有无限能源和空间的地方。我是说，太空（Space）之所以叫“太空”（Space/空间），是有原因的。😂\n\n通过直接利用近乎恒定的太阳能，且运营维护成本极低，这些卫星将彻底改变我们扩展计算能力的方式。太空永远阳光普照！ 发射由一百万颗卫星组成的星座作为“轨道数据中心”，是人类迈向卡尔达肖夫 II 级文明（能够利用恒星的全部能量）的第一步，这将支持当今数十亿人的 AI 应用，并确保人类多行星未来的实现。\n\n轨道数据中心 (Orbital Data Centers)\n\n在航天史上，从未有过一种运载工具能够将天基数据中心、月球永久基地或火星城市所需的百万吨级质量送入太空。即使在发射次数创历史新高的 2025 年，送入轨道的有效载荷也仅约为 3000 吨，主要还是由我们的猎鹰（Falcon）火箭搭载的星链（Starlink）卫星。\n\n发射数千颗卫星的需求成为了猎鹰计划的强制驱动力（Forcing Function），推动了递归式的改进，从而达到了实现天基互联网所需的前所未有的发射频率。今年，星舰（Starship） 将开始把更强大的 V3 星链卫星送入轨道，其单次发射增加的星座容量将是目前猎鹰发射 V2 卫星的 20 倍以上。星舰还将发射下一代“手机直连”卫星，实现地球全覆盖的蜂窝网络连接。\n\n正如星链推动了猎鹰一样，部署天基数据中心所需的庞大卫星数量，将把星舰推向更高的高度。以此为目标，星舰将实现每小时发射一次、单次运载 200 吨的能力，这意味着每年可将数百万吨物资送入轨道及更远的地方，开启人类探索星辰的激动人心的未来。\n\n基本的数学账是这样的：\n\n每年发射 100 万吨卫星，每吨产生 100 kW 的计算能力，这意味着每年将增加 100 吉瓦（GW） 的 AI 计算能力，且无需持续的运营或维护需求。最终，我们将实现从地球每年发射 1 太瓦（TW） 算力的路径。\n\n我的预测是，在 2 到 3 年内，生成 AI 算力成本最低的方式将是在太空。 这种成本效率将使创新型公司能够以前所未有的速度和规模训练其 AI 模型并处理数据，加速我们在物理学理解和造福人类的技术发明上的突破。\n\n这个新的星座将建立在 SpaceX 现有的宽带卫星系统已验证成功的太空可持续性设计和运营策略之上，包括完善的寿命终止处理（end-of-life disposal）。\n\n虽然从地球发射 AI 卫星是目前的重点，但星舰的能力也将支持在其他星球上的行动。得益于在轨推进剂加注等技术进步，星舰将能够把大量货物送上月球。\n\n一旦到达那里，建立用于科学和制造的永久基地将成为可能。月球工厂可以利用月球资源制造卫星，并将它们部署到更深远的太空中。通过使用电磁质量驱动器（Electromagnetic Mass Driver）和月球制造技术，我们将有可能每年向深空部署 500 到 1000 TW 的 AI 卫星，从而在卡尔达肖夫指数上有意义地攀升，并利用太阳能量中不可忽视的一部分。\n\n我们要让天基数据中心成为现实，其解锁的能力将资助并赋能月球基地的自我成长、火星文明的建立，并最终实现向全宇宙的扩张。\n\n感谢你们为意识的光锥（Light Cone of Consciousness）所做的一切，以及未来将做的一切。\n\nAd Astra!  向星辰大海进发！\n\nElon",

      "text": "My biggest takeaways from Dr. Becky (@GoodInside):\n\n1. Boundaries are what you tell someone you will do—and require the other person to do nothing. If your “boundary” needs someone else to comply, you’re making a request and giving away your power. A true boundary: “I’m going to stand between you and the buttons. If you try to press them, I’m not going to let you.\"\n\n2. “I believe you, and I believe in you” is the formula for helping someone through a hard time. “I believe you” means having one foot in the hole with them—acknowledging their experience as real. “I believe in you” means keeping one foot out—seeing a more capable version of them than they can see in the moment. Both together create movement.\n\n3. The human brain seeks sturdy leadership. A sturdy leader sees someone else’s emotional experience as real for them, but is not overwhelmed by it themselves. The pilot who says, “I hear you screaming—that makes sense; it’s very bumpy—and I know what I’m doing. I’ll see you when we land” creates safety even when the turbulence stays the same.\n\n4. Optimizing for short-term happiness in childhood is the quickest way to build anxiety and fragility in adulthood. What kids are really learning in their early years is what range of experiences they can cope with. If every form of discomfort gets brought to zero, they wire themselves to believe that anything other than happiness is unmanageable.\n\n5. Connect before you correct. When someone isn’t listening or cooperating, it’s often because you haven’t built a bridge to their world first. Dr. Becky illustrates this with a powerful example: “If my husband demanded I do taxes while I’m finally settling in to read, I don’t have a listening problem—I have a husband problem.” Connection isn’t just about being nice. It forms a bridge between two people so they can act together toward a common goal. At work, this might mean acknowledging someone’s current priorities before asking them to shift focus.\n\n6. Repair is the single most powerful relationship strategy. The best relationships aren’t defined by perfection but by how we repair after mistakes. In both parenting and leadership, the willingness to take responsibility, acknowledge impact, and commit to improvement builds trust more effectively than trying to be flawless.\n\n7. Default to the “most generous interpretation.” When someone belabors their point in a meeting, the least generous interpretation is “They’re being a baby.” The most generous might be “They don’t feel heard.” Using MGI shifts your interventions: instead of complaining about the person, you have one conversation that moves things forward.\n\n8. Bad behavior at any age is feelings that overpower skills, and is not a choice. Kids are born with all the feelings and none of the skills to manage them. Punishing or shaming doesn’t teach new skills; it increases the gap between feelings and skills. The job is to set boundaries around out-of-control behavior and then teach the skills that were missing.",

      "text": "Research from Imperial College London and Microsoft Research.\n\nAccording to this work, more compute FLOPs won't solve the AI agent inference problem.\n\nAs AI agents move from chatbots to coding, web-use, and computer-use workflows, the memory capacity wall becomes the binding constraint. The industry needs to rethink inference infrastructure from the ground up.\n\nThe default approach to scaling AI inference today remains GPU-centric: pack more compute onto bigger chips, stack more HBM, and hope the architecture fits every workload.\n\nThe industry is building gigawatt-scale data centers around this assumption.\n\nBut AI agents break this assumption entirely.\n\nThis new research introduces a framework based on two metrics, Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF), that exposes why the classic roofline model fails to capture what actually bottlenecks agent inference.\n\nHere is what the researchers find:\n\nDifferent agentic workflows create wildly different hardware demands.\n\nA coding agent's context can snowball to 300K-1M tokens across 20-30 environment interactions. A computer-use agent consumes orders of magnitude more prefill tokens than a chatbot. Same base model, completely different system requirements.\n\nAt batch size 1 with 1M context, a single DeepSeek-R1 request needs roughly 900GB of memory, far exceeding any single accelerator. Even a LLaMA-70B coding agent can exceed a B200's capacity ceiling. Meanwhile, the KV cache loading during decode drives OI so low that hardware spends most of its time moving data, not computing.\n\nThe paper argues this means disaggregated serving should be the default. Prefill and decode phases show drastically different operational intensity and need specialized accelerators. NVIDIA's upcoming Rubin CPX already targets prefill-only workloads, but the authors predict more than two accelerator types will be needed within a single inference system.\n\nHeterogeneous architectures with disaggregated compute and memory, connected by optical interconnects, will let data centers rebalance hardware within a single generation rather than waiting for new chips.\n\nHomogeneous GPU clusters will amplify the mismatched scaling between compute, memory, and networking.\n\nPaper: https://t.co/5pYqLB3P8A\n\nLearn to build effective AI agents in our academy: https://t.co/LRnpZN7L4c",

      "text": "Elon 说三年内要在太空上建造数据中心，估计这是为了给 SpaceX IPO 之后的故事画一个新的大饼。让 Gemini DeepThink 设计了一个太空中的散热方案，同时和地面上的数据中心做了个成本对比！\n\n“真空绝热”这一最大难题，传统的被动散热板对于高密度 AI 算力完全不够。“晨昏·热泵”主动辐射系统 （Dawn-Dusk Active Thermal Loop）是一套结合了轨道力学与主动热力学的极致散热方案，也是一个典型的 AI 平均主义设计😆\n\n1. 轨道策略：晨昏线太阳同步轨道\n\n- 设计核心： 在解决散热前，先通过轨道选择解决“能源”和“温差”问题；\n- 原理： 将数据中心部署在地球的晨昏线（白天与黑夜交界处）轨道上；\n- 效益： 卫星可实现24小时持续日照（无需携带沉重的电池组），同时散热面可以永久背对太阳，只面向零下270℃的深空背景，这是提升散热效率的几何基础；\n\n2. 核心吸热：双相浸没式液冷\n\n- 设计： 服务器主板完全浸没在绝缘介电液（如工程氟化液）的加压舱中。\n- 原理： 利用液体沸腾汽化带走热量。相变潜热的吸热效率极高，且液体本身就是一层优秀的中子/质子辐射屏蔽层，一举两得。\n\n3. 热力增强：磁悬浮离心热泵 (Centrifugal Heat Pump) —— 方案的关键创新\n\n- 痛点： 辐射散热公式是 $P \\propto T^4$（温度的 4 次方）。如果直接排放 60°C 的热量，辐射效率很低，需要巨大的散热板；\n- 设计： 在回路中加入压缩机，主动消耗一部分电力，将汽化后的工质蒸汽压缩升温至 100°C - 120°C。\n- 物理依据： 虽然多消耗了电力，但将辐射体温度从 330K提升到 390K，辐射效率提升了约  2 倍。这意味着可以将昂贵且沉重的散热器面积缩小一半，这是大幅降低发射成本的关键。\n\n4. 散热终端：折叠式石墨烯“脉动”辐射翼\n\n- 材料： 采用柔性石墨烯复合膜，导热率是铜的 5 倍，重量仅为塑料级别。\n- 结构： 发射时像折扇一样收拢，入轨后展开为数百平方米的阵列。\n- 流道： 内部嵌入脉动热管（Oscillating Heat Pipe），利用工质压力波推动循环，无机械运动部件，可靠性高。\n- 涂层： 表面喷涂Vantablack（碳纳米管黑体），发射率接近 1.0，最大化向深空排热。\n\n为了直观对比，我们设定建设一个 1兆瓦算力规模的数据中心（约支持 50 个高密度 AI 机柜），运营周期 5年。\n\n1. 地球表面数据中心成本\n\n- 基础设施 (CapEx)：约 $1,500万美元，包含土地、机房建设、电力设施、精密空调。\n\n- IT硬件 (CapEx)：约 $2,000万美元，高性能 AI 服务器集群。\n\n- 运营电费 (OpEx)：约 $500万美元，按工业电价 $0.10/kWh 计算，1MW 跑 5 年（含 PUE 损耗）。\n\n- 其他运维：约 $300万美元（人员、安保、水冷用水）。\n\n地球端总成本 (TCO)： 约 $4,300 万美元。\n\n2. 太空数据中心成本\n\n我们需要把多少东西送上去？\n\n质量估算： 1MW IT 设备(20吨) + 太阳能阵列(30吨) + 散热与结构(30吨) + 屏蔽冗余(20吨) ≈ 100吨。由于采用了“晨昏轨道”策略，省去了约40吨的电池重量。\n\n场景A：当前发射价格 (猎鹰9号 Falcon 9)\n\n发射成本：~$2,500/kg\n发射费：100,000 kg × $2,500 = $2.5亿美元\n硬件费：需抗辐射加固和3倍冗余，约 $6,000万美元\n总成本：>$3.1亿美元（是地球的 7 倍，完全不可行）\n\n场景B：星舰 (Starship) 成熟时代（未来）\n\n发射成本：目标降至 ~$100/kg。\n发射费：100,000 kg × $100 = $1,000万美元\n硬件费：$6,000万美元（硬件成本依然高，因为无法维修，必须堆冗余）\n运营费：$0 (太阳能免费，无人值守)\n总成本：约 $7,000 万美元\n\n总结：即便在 SpaceX 星舰发射成本极低的情况下，由于硬件无法维修（导致的高冗余成本）和散热系统的复杂性，太空数据中心的成本目前仍高于地球🚀",

      "text": "Another year of rapid AI advances has created more opportunities than ever for anyone — including those just entering the field — to build software. In fact, many companies just can’t find enough skilled AI talent. Every winter holiday, I spend some time learning and building, and I hope you will too. This helps me sharpen old skills and learn new ones, and it can help you grow your career in tech.\n\nTo be skilled at building AI systems, I recommend that you:\n- Take AI courses\n- Practice building AI systems\n- (Optionally) read research papers\n\nLet me share why each of these is important.\n\nI’ve heard some developers advise others to just plunge into building things without worrying about learning. This is bad advice! Unless you’re already surrounded by a community of experienced AI developers, plunging into building without understanding the foundations of AI means you’ll risk reinventing the wheel or — more likely — reinventing the wheel badly!\n\nFor example, during interviews with job candidates, I have spoken with developers who reinvented standard RAG document chunking strategies, duplicated existing evaluation techniques for Agentic AI, or ended up with messy LLM context management code. If they had taken a couple of relevant courses, they would have better understood the building blocks that already exist. They could still rebuild these blocks from scratch if they wished, or perhaps even invent something superior to existing solutions, but they would have avoided weeks of unnecessary work. So structured learning is important. Moreover, I find taking courses really fun. Rather than watching Netflix, I prefer watching a course by a knowledgeable AI instructor any day!\n\nAt the same time, taking courses alone isn’t enough. There are many lessons that you’ll gain only from hands-on practice. Learning the theory behind how an airplane works is very important to becoming a pilot, but no one has ever learned to be a pilot just by taking courses. At some point, jumping into the pilot's seat is critical! The good news is that by learning to use highly agentic coders, the process of building is the easiest it has ever been. And learning about AI building blocks might inspire you with new ideas for things to build. If I’m not feeling inspired about what projects to work on, I will usually either take courses or read research papers, and after doing this for a while, I always end up with many new ideas. Moreover, I find building really fun, and I hope you will too.\n\nFinally, not everyone has to do this, but I find that many of the strongest candidates on the job market today at least occasionally read research papers. While I find research papers much harder to digest than courses, they contain a lot of knowledge that has not yet been translated to easier-to-understand formats. I put this much lower priority than either taking courses or practicing building, but if you have an opportunity to strengthen your ability to read papers, I urge you to do so too. I find taking courses and building to be fun, and reading papers can be more of a grind, but the flashes of insight I get from reading papers are delightful.\n\nHave a wonderful winter holiday and a Happy New Year. In addition to learning and building, I hope you'll spend time with loved ones — that, too, is important!\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/MaWDs0AbzG ]",

        "text": "I'm thrilled to announce the definitive course on Claude Code, created with @AnthropicAI and taught by Elie Schoppik @eschoppik. If you want to use highly agentic coding - where AI works autonomously for many minutes or longer, not just completing code snippets - this is it.\n\nClaude Code has been a game-changer for many developers (including me!), but there's real depth to using it well. This comprehensive course covers everything from fundamentals to advanced patterns.\n\nAfter this short course, you'll be able to:\n- Orchestrate multiple Claude subagents to work on different parts of your codebase simultaneously\n- Tag Claude in GitHub issues and have it autonomously create, review, and merge pull requests\n- Transform messy Jupyter notebooks into clean, production-ready dashboards\n- Use MCP tools like Playwright so Claude can see what's wrong with your UI and fix it autonomously\n\nWhether you're new to Claude Code or already using it, you'll discover powerful capabilities that can fundamentally change how you build software.\n\nI'm very excited about what agentic coding lets everyone now do. Please take this course!\n\nhttps://t.co/HGM8ArDalK",

        "text": "Releasing a new \"Agentic Reviewer\" for research papers. I started coding this as a weekend project, and @jyx_su made it much better.\n\nI was inspired by a student who had a paper rejected 6 times over 3 years. Their feedback loop -- waiting ~6 months for feedback each time -- was painfully slow. We wanted to see if an agentic workflow can help researchers iterate faster.\n\nWhen we trained the system on ICLR 2025 reviews and measured Spearman correlation (higher is better) on the test set:\n- Correlation between two human reviewers: 0.41\n- Correlation between AI and a human reviewer: 0.42\n\nThis suggests agentic reviewing is approaching human-level performance.\n\nThe agent grounds its feedback by searching arXiv, so it works best in fields like AI where research is freely published there. It’s an experimental tool, but I hope it helps you with your research.\n\nCheck it out here: https://t.co/n7ctnDilJJ",

An industrial ecosystem of builders, companies and solutions further democratizes AI to provide broad resilience, and ensures the US continues to lead as AI increasingly powers everything around us.\n\nAs AI and biotech rapidly advance, biodefense is one of those verticals.

      "text": "Is there an AI bubble? With the massive number of dollars going into AI infrastructure such as OpenAI’s $1.4 trillion plan and Nvidia briefly reaching a $5 trillion market cap, many have asked if speculation and hype have driven the values of AI investments above sustainable values. However, AI isn’t monolithic, and different areas look bubbly to different degrees.\n- AI application layer: There is underinvestment. The potential is still much greater than most realize.\n- AI infrastructure for inference: This still needs significant investment.\n- AI infrastructure for model training: I’m still cautiously optimistic about this sector, but there could also be a bubble.\n\nCaveat: I am absolutely not giving investment advice!\n\nAI application layer. There are many applications yet to be built over the coming decade using new AI technology. Almost by definition, applications that are built on top of AI infrastructure/technology (such as LLM APIs) have to be more valuable than the infrastructure, since we need them to be able to pay the infrastructure and technology providers.\n\nI am seeing many green shoots across many businesses that are applying agentic workflows, and am confident this will grow. I have also spoken with many Venture Capital investors who hesitate to invest in AI applications because they feel they don’t know how to pick winners, whereas the recipe for deploying $1B to build AI infrastructure is better understood. Some have also bought into the hype that almost all AI applications will be wiped out merely by frontier LLM companies improving their foundation models. Overall, I believe there is significant underinvestment in AI applications. This area remains a huge focus for my venture studio, AI Fund.\n\nAI infrastructure for inference. Despite AI’s low penetration today, infrastructure providers are already struggling to fulfill demand for processing power to generate tokens. Several of my teams are worried about whether we can get enough inference capacity, and both cost and inference throughput are limiting our ability to use even more. It is a good problem to have that businesses are supply-constrained rather than demand-constrained. The latter is a much more common problem, when not enough people want your product. But insufficient supply is nonetheless a problem, which is why I am glad our industry is investing significantly in scaling up inference capacity.\n\nAs one concrete example of high demand for token generation, highly agentic coders are progressing rapidly. I’ve long been a fan of Claude Code; OpenAI Codex also improved dramatically with the release of GPT-5; and Gemini 3 has made Google CLI very competitive. As these tools improve, their adoption will grow. At the same time, overall market penetration is still low, and many developers are still using older generations of coding tools (and some aren’t even using any agentic coding tools). As market penetration grows —  I’m confident it will, given how useful these tools are — aggregate demand for token generation will grow.\n\nI predicted early last year that we’d need more inference capacity, partly because of agentic workflows. Since then, the need has become more acute. As a society, we need more capacity for AI inference. \n\nHaving said that, I’m not saying it’s impossible to lose money investing in this sector. If we end up overbuilding — and I don’t currently know if we will — then providers may end up having to sell capacity at a loss or at low returns. I hope investors in this space do well financially. The good news, however, is that even if we overbuild, this capacity will get used, and it will be good for application builders!\n\nAI infrastructure for model training. I am happy to see the investments going into training bigger models. But, of the three buckets of investments, this seems the riskiest. If open-source/open-weight models continue to grow in market share, then some companies that are pouring billions into training models might not see an attractive financial return on their investment.\n\nAdditionally, algorithmic and hardware improvements are making it cheaper each year to train models of a given level of capability, so the “technology moat” for training frontier models is weak. (That said, ChatGPT has become a strong consumer brand, and so it enjoys a strong brand moat, while Gemini, assisted by Google's massive distribution advantage, is also making a strong showing.)\n\nI remain bullish about AI investments broadly. But what is the downside scenario — that is, is there a bubble that will pop? One scenario that worries me: If part of the AI stack (perhaps in training infra) suffers from overinvestment and collapses, it could lead to negative market sentiment around AI more broadly and an irrational outflow of interest away from investing in AI, despite the field overall having strong fundamentals. I don’t think this will happen, but if it does, it would be unfortunate since there’s still a lot of work in AI that I consider highly deserving of much more investment.\n\nWarren Buffett popularized Benjamin Graham’s quote, “In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” He meant that in the short term, stock prices are driven by investor sentiment and speculation; but in the long term, they are driven by fundamental, intrinsic value. I find it hard to forecast sentiment and speculation, but am very confident about the long-term health of AI’s fundamentals. So my plan is just to keep building!\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/psPlIFRJsi ]",

Your options are (1) actively try to prevent the act (like Claude did here), (2) just refuse to help (in which case the user might be able to jailbreak/manipulate the model to help using different queries), (3) always comply with the user's request. (2) and (3) are reasonable, but I bet your preferred approach will also have some undesirable edge cases -- you'll just have to bite a different bullet. \n\nKnee-jerk criticism incentivizes (1) less transparency -- companies don't perform or talk about evals that present the model with adversarially-designed situations (2) something like \"Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics\", where you get get blamed for edge-case model behaviors only if you observe or discuss them.",

Dozens of messages of pasting screenshots of text conversations to analyze tone of responses; whether to include an exclamation point to whether a smiley face was appropriately flirty. Apparently his ex-GF was talking to another guy in her lab and too stressed with work to give him attention, but also let him borrow her car, so he was getting mixed signals. Random stranger next to me was also spectating and found it so funny he literally cracked up in the middle of the talk. Convo ended with ChatGPT saying “you just had sex last week so youre no second class citizen.” Weirdest mix of pity, fascination, and awe I’ve ever felt",

      "text": "U.S. policies are driving allies away from using American AI technology. This is leading to interest in sovereign AI — a nation’s ability to access AI technology without relying on foreign powers. This weakens U.S. influence, but might lead to increased competition and support for open source.\n\nThe U.S. invented the transistor, the internet, and the transformer architecture powering modern AI. It has long been a technology powerhouse. I love America, and am working hard towards its success. But its actions over many years, taken by multiple administrations, have made other nations worry about over reliance on it.\n\nIn 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, U.S. sanctions on banks linked to Russian oligarchs resulted in ordinary consumers’ credit cards being shut off. Shortly before leaving office, Biden implemented “AI diffusion” export controls that limited the ability of many nations — including U.S. allies — to buy AI chips.\n\nUnder Trump, the “America first” approach has significantly accelerated pushing other nations away. There have been broad and chaotic tariffs imposed on both allies and adversaries. Threats to take over Greenland. An unfriendly attitude toward immigration — an overreaction to the chaos at the southern border during Biden’s administration — including atrocious tactics by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) that resulted in agents shooting dead Renée Good, Alex Pretti, and others. Global media has widely disseminated videos of ICE terrorizing American cities, and I have highly skilled, law-abiding friends overseas who now hesitate to travel to the U.S., fearing arbitrary detention.\n\nGiven AI’s strategic importance, nations want to ensure no foreign power can cut off their access. Hence, sovereign AI.\n\nSovereign AI is still a vague, rather than precisely defined, concept. Complete independence is impractical: There are no good substitutes to AI chips designed in the U.S. and manufactured in Taiwan, and a lot of energy equipment and computer hardware are manufactured in China. But there is a clear desire to have alternatives to the frontier models from leading U.S. companies OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Partly because of this, open-weight Chinese models like DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, and GLM are gaining rapid adoption, especially outside the U.S.\n\nWhen it comes to sovereign AI, fortunately one does not have to build everything. By joining the global open-source community, a nation can secure its own access to AI. The goal isn’t to control everything; rather, it is to make sure no one else can control what you do with it. Indeed, nations use open source software like Linux, Python, and PyTorch. Even though no nation can control this software, no one else can stop anyone from using it as they see fit.\n\nThis is spurring nations to invest more in open source and open weight models. The UAE (under the leadership of my former grad-school officemate Eric Xing!) just launched K2 Think, an open-source reasoning model. India, France, South Korea, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, and others are developing domestic foundation models, and many more countries are working to ensure access to compute infrastructure under their control or perhaps under trusted allies’ control.\n\nGlobal fragmentation and erosion of trust among democracies is bad. Nonetheless, a silver lining would be if this results in more competition. U.S. search engines Google and Bing came to dominate web search globally, but Baidu (in China) and Yandex (in Russia) did well locally. If nations support domestic champions — a tall order given the giants’ advantages — perhaps we’ll end up with a larger number of thriving companies, which would slow down consolidation and encourage competition. Further, participating in open source is the most inexpensive way for countries to stay at the cutting edge.\n\nLast week, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, many business and government leaders spoke about their growing reluctance to rely on U.S. technology providers and desire for alternatives. Ironically, “America first” policies might end up strengthening the world’s access to AI.\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/Nr5kfzcs5w ]",

        "text": "What if you could meet the you who made the other choice?\n\nI built Forks with @MiniMax_AI M2-her. It lets you have real conversations with alternate versions of yourself. \n\nWith OpenClaw, Moltbook, Ralph Wiggum Loops, agents are becoming divergent versions of ourselves.\n\nThese always-on agents develop patterns, remember context, and build relationships with the people you work with (even those you haven't met).\n\nThey're both \"you.\" But they're executing different decision branches. Accumulating different experiences. The fork metaphor becomes literal, same starting state, divergent execution paths, both running simultaneously.\n\nForks uses a three-agent pipeline (Interview → Research → Architect) to build your other version.\n\n- Interview Agent: Extracts the emotional core of your decision\n- Research Agent: Grounds the alternate timeline in real facts \n- Persona Architect: Synthesizes a psychologically coherent alternate self with Big Five traits, drift prevention, and authentic memory structures\n\nYou describe a pivotal decision you didn't make. Three AI agents interview you, research the context, and architect a deeply calibrated persona of your alternate self.\n\nVery rough demo: https://t.co/Jg6ebFrrmZ\n\nThe hardest problem in this project is character consistency. Most LLMs are great at one-turn responses. When you have a 50-turn emotional conversation with an AI character, they drift. \n\nMiniMax's M2-her model is engineered for role-play over long contexts. The model understands physical and narrative logic, if you and your alternate self have said goodbye and walked away, it won't force impossible dialogue. Your alternate self maintains a consistent personality, memories, and emotional responses across long conversations.\n\nForks is a context engineering and persona embodiment experiment. You create an alternate self, you talk to it, you explore the \"what if.\"\n\nBut Im confident that in the very near future, we will start creating our different digital versions:\n- One self is building a startup\n- One is a designer\n- One is in love\n\nThey all have your context. Your voice. Your preferences. But they're living different lives in the digital world, making decisions you don't witness, having experiences you only hear about in their reports.\n\nForks is open source. Built with MiniMax and @openclaw.\n\nIf you're thinking about what it means to have multiple simultaneous selves or you just want to talk to the you who made the other choice, go fork it.",

      "text": "Microsoft did it again!\n\nBuilding with AI agents almost never works on the first try.\n\nYou spend days tweaking prompts, adding examples, hoping it gets better. Nothing systematic, just guesswork.\n\nThis is exactly what Microsoft's Agent Lightning solves.\n\nIt's an open-source framework that trains ANY AI agent with reinforcement learning. Works with LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, OpenAI SDK, or plain Python.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n> Your agent runs normally with whatever framework you're using. Just add a lightweight agl.emit() helper or let the tracer auto-collect everything.\n\n> Agent Lightning captures every prompt, tool call, and reward. Stores them as structured events.\n\n> You pick an algorithm (RL, prompt optimization, fine-tuning). It reads the events, learns patterns, and generates improved prompts or policy weights.\n\n> The Trainer pushes updates back to your agent. Your agent gets better without you rewriting anything.\n\nThe best part: you can also optimize individual agents in a multi-agent system.\n\nI have shared the link to the GitHub repo in the replies!\n\nLet me know if I should cover this in a video demo!",

      "text": "How can businesses go beyond using AI for incremental efficiency gains to create transformative impact? I write from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, where I’ve been speaking with many CEOs about how to use AI for growth. A recurring theme is that running many experimental, bottom-up AI projects — letting a thousand flowers bloom — has failed to lead to significant payoffs. Instead, bigger gains require workflow redesign: taking a broader, perhaps top-down view of the multiple steps in a process and changing how they work together from end to end.\n\nConsider a bank issuing loans. The workflow consists of several discrete stages: \n\nMarketing -> Application -> Preliminary Approval -> Final Review -> Execution\n\nSuppose each step used to be manual. Preliminary Approval used to require an hour-long human review, but a new agentic system can do this automatically in 10 minutes. Swapping human review for AI review — but keeping everything else the same — gives a minor efficiency gain but isn’t transformative.\n\nHere’s what would be transformative: Instead of applicants waiting a week for a human to review their application, they can get a decision in 10 minutes. When that happens, the loan becomes a more compelling product, and that better customer experience allows lenders to attract more applications and ultimately issue more loans.\n\nHowever, making this change requires taking a broader business or product perspective, not just a technology perspective. Further, it changes the workflow of loan processing. Switching to offering a “10-minute loan” product would require changing how it is marketed. Applications would need to be digitized and routed more efficiently, and final review and execution would need to be redesigned to handle a larger volume.\n\nEven though AI is applied only to one step, Preliminary Approval, we end up implementing not just a point solution but a broader workflow redesign that transforms the product offering.\n\nAt AI Aspire (an advisory firm I co-lead), here’s what we see: Bottom-up innovation matters because the people closest to problems often see solutions first. But scaling such ideas to create transformative impact often requires seeing how AI can transform entire workflows end to end, not just individual steps, and this is where top-down strategic direction and innovation can help.\n\nThis year's WEF meeting, as in previous years, has been an energizing event. Among technologists, frequent topics of discussion include Agentic AI (when I coined this term, I was not expecting to see it plastered on billboards and buildings!), Sovereign AI (how nations can control their own access to AI), Talent (the challenging job market for recent graduates, and how to upskill nations), and data-center infrastructure (how to address bottlenecks in energy, talent, GPU chips, and memory). I will address some of these topics in future posts.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, I hope all of us in AI will keep building bridges that connect nations, sharing through open source, and building to benefit all nations and all people.\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/Ck52mNGX4a ]",

        "text": "Fun fact: OpenAI handles 800 million users on ChatGPT with just one PostgreSQL primary and 50 read replicas 🤯\n\nToday, OpenAI published an engineering blog explaining how they scaled their Postgres setup to support a massive 800 million users using a single primary and 50 multi-region replicas.\n\nThey dive into details around their scaling approach, the PgBouncer proxy, cache locking, and cascading read replicas. It is genuinely neat and impressive.\n\nI just published a video on my YouTube channel where I dissect the blog and break down the nuances.\n\nGive it a watch - it is short and fun.",

If it is too far out-of-distribution, RL struggles because the model lacks the necessary priors.\n\nThis has been known before, but it's nice to see it formalized with data and figures to reference.",

      "text": "I was happy to see the second version of the OpenAI Model Spec released last week. Sharing my notes:\n\n- One notable change is that each section is labeled with an authority level, from \"platform\" (can't be overridden by the user or developer) to \"guideline\" (can be easily overridden). This seems like a nice conceptual simplification of the notion of \"defaults\" in the previous version, unifying the authority levels of the spec itself with the levels of different messages.\n- A couple lines are refreshingly honest. The objective \"Maintain OpenAI's license to operate by protecting it from legal and reputational harm\", and \"[why chains of thought hidden] ... as well as for competitive reasons.\" This is the kind of thing that'd usually get watered down by comms/legal/policy teams at a typical company.\n- The spec starts to cover a couple topics that weren't present before, such as multimodality (eg using accents, avoiding premature warnings) and agents (with a discussion of what it means for an agent to overstep when pursuing user-defined goals).\n- There's a new untrusted_text feature, which presumably means there'll be an API feature for quoted text, where it's delimited by special tokens rather than leaving the developer to handle quoting and the model to interpret the quoting. This is useful for protecting against prompt injection.\n- In a couple places, a point from the previous spec is derived more from first principles in this one. The most controversial part of the previous spec was \"don't try to change anyone's mind\", wrt users having false beliefs like \"the earth is flat\". Now this is justified as a special case of \"highlight possible misalignments\", following from \"assume the user's long-term goals include learning, self-improvement, and truth-seeking\".\n- This is a subtle and debatable point, I like the emphasis on user freedom (\"intellectual freedom\" is used a few times), as opposed to more of a cost benefit analysis. It's like \"maximize user freedom subject to constraints\" as opposed to \"do cost benefit analysis to enable beneficial use cases and prevent harmful ones\". The latter would give the platform too much moral authority.\n- Detail added in various places, e.g. more style guidelines about conversational behavior, more detail about privileged information in developer messages.\n- Still no erotica",

      "text": "What happens when a skill can be almost fully automated with AI? Do these jobs simply disappear?\n\nInstead of purely speculating we can simply look at concrete examples. Take translators. Translation can be 100% automated with AI, and this capability has been around since 2023. So we have 2-3 years of data.\n\nWhat we see so far:\n\n- Stable FTE count, but slow hiring or no hiring\n- Nature of the job switched from doing it yourself to supervising AI output (post-editing)\n- Increased task volume\n- Decreased hourly rates\n- Freelancers getting cut\n\nWe are now starting to see the same pattern with software jobs.\n\nOverall there's definitely some pressure on employment but we're very far from \"the jobs just go away\". In fact the number of full-time translators is still modestly increasing.\n\nWhen the economy rebounds from the ongoing \"stealth recession\" and companies start hiring again, the world will have more professional software engineers than we did before GenAI.\n\nThe mass layoffs you're about to see in the tech sector won't be caused by job automation. They will be caused by fears about the economy, like in 2022. It won't be unrelated to AI, mind you, since it ties into big tech capex needs. But it won't be due to automation.",

      "text": "Software development is undergoing a renaissance in front of our eyes.\n\nIf you haven't used the tools recently, you likely are underestimating what you're missing. Since December, there's been a step function improvement in what tools like Codex can do. Some great engineers at OpenAI yesterday told me that their job has fundamentally changed since December. Prior to then, they could use Codex for unit tests; now it writes essentially all the code and does a great deal of their operations and debugging. Not everyone has yet made that leap, but it's usually because of factors besides the capability of the model.\n\nEvery company faces the same opportunity now, and navigating it well — just like with cloud computing or the Internet — requires careful thought. This post shares how OpenAI is currently approaching retooling our teams towards agentic software development. We're still learning and iterating, but here's how we're thinking about it right now:\n\nAs a first step, by March 31st, we're aiming that:\n\n(1) For any technical task, the tool of first resort for humans is interacting with an agent rather than using an editor or terminal.\n(2) The default way humans utilize agents is explicitly evaluated as safe, but also productive enough that most workflows do not need additional permissions.\n\nIn order to get there, here's what we recommended to the team a few weeks ago:\n\n1. Take the time to try out the tools. The tools do sell themselves — many people have had amazing experiences with 5.2 in Codex, after having churned from codex web a few months ago. But many people are also so busy they haven't had a chance to try Codex yet or got stuck thinking \"is there any way it could do X\" rather than just trying.\n  - Designate an \"agents captain\" for your team — the primary person responsible for thinking about how agents can be brought into the teams' workflow.\n  - Share experiences or questions in a few designated internal channels\n  - Take a day for a company-wide Codex hackathon\n\n2. Create skills and AGENTS[.md].\n  - Create and maintain an AGENTS[.md] for any project you work on; update the AGENTS[.md] whenever the agent does something wrong or struggles with a task.\n  - Write skills for anything that you get Codex to do, and commit it to the skills directory in a shared repository\n\n3. Inventory and make accessible any internal tools.\n  - Maintain a list of tools that your team relies on, and make sure someone takes point on making it agent-accessible (such as via a CLI or MCP server).\n\n4. Structure codebases to be agent-first. With the models changing so fast, this is still somewhat untrodden ground, and will require some exploration.\n  - Write tests which are quick to run, and create high-quality interfaces between components.\n\n5. Say no to slop. Managing AI generated code at scale is an emerging problem, and will require new processes and conventions to keep code quality high\n  - Ensure that some human is accountable for any code that gets merged. As a code reviewer, maintain at least the same bar as you would for human-written code, and make sure the author understands what they're submitting.\n\n6. Work on basic infra. There's a lot of room for everyone to build basic infrastructure, which can be guided by internal user feedback. The core tools are getting a lot better and more usable, but there's a lot of infrastructure that currently go around the tools, such as observability, tracking not just the committed code but the agent trajectories that led to them, and central management of the tools that agents are able to use.\n\nOverall, adopting tools like Codex is not just a technical but also a deep cultural change, with a lot of downstream implications to figure out. We encourage every manager to drive this with their team, and to think through other action items — for example, per item 5 above, what else can prevent a lot of \"functionally-correct but poorly-maintainable code\" from creeping into codebases.",

      "text": "I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.",

      "text": "As amazing as LLMs are, improving their knowledge today involves a more piecemeal process than is widely appreciated. I’ve written before about how AI is amazing... but not that amazing. Well, it is also true that LLMs are general... but not that general. We shouldn’t buy into the inaccurate hype that LLMs are a path to AGI in just a few years, but we also shouldn’t buy into the opposite, also inaccurate hype that they are only demoware. Instead, I find it helpful to have a more precise understanding of the current path to building more intelligent  models.\n\nFirst, LLMs are indeed a more general form of intelligence than earlier generations of technology. This is why a single LLM can be applied to a wide range of tasks. The first wave of LLM technology accomplished this by training on the public web, which contains a lot of information about a wide range of topics. This made their knowledge far more general than earlier algorithms that were trained to carry out a single task such as predicting housing prices or playing a single game like chess or Go. However, they’re far less general than human abilities. For instance, after pretraining on the entire content of the public web, an LLM still struggles to adapt to write in certain styles that many editors would be able to, or use simple websites reliably.\n\nAfter leveraging pretty much all the open information on the web, progress got harder. Today, if a frontier lab wants an LLM to do well on a specific task — such as code using a specific programming language, or say sensible things about a specific niche in, say, healthcare or finance — researchers might go through a laborious process of finding or generating lots of data for that domain and then preparing that data (cleaning low-quality text, deduplicating, paraphrasing, etc.) to create data to give an LLM that knowledge.\n\nOr, to get a model to perform certain tasks, such as use a web browser, developers might go through an even more laborious process of creating many RL gyms (simulated environments) to let an algorithm repeatedly practice a narrow set of tasks.\n\nA typical human, despite having seen vastly less text or practiced far less in computer-use training environments than today's frontier models, nonetheless can generalize to a far wider range of tasks than a frontier model. Humans might do this by taking advantage of continuous learning from feedback, or by having superior representations of non-text input (the way LLMs tokenize images still seems like a hack to me), and many other mechanisms that we do not yet understand.\n\nAdvancing frontier models today requires making a lot of manual decisions and taking a data-centric AI approach to engineering the data we use to train our models. Future breakthroughs might allow us to advance LLMs in a less piecemeal fashion than I describe here. But even if they don’t, the ongoing piecemeal improvements, coupled with the limited degree to which these models do generalize and exhibit “emergent behaviors,” will continue to drive rapid progress.\n\nEither way, we should plan for many more years of hard work. A long, hard — and fun! — slog remains ahead to build more intelligent models.\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/SHRN5JDvTW ]",
