Connectionism will cover topics as varied as our research is: from kernel numerics to prompt engineering. Here we share what we are working on and connect with the research community frequently and openly.\n\nThe name Connectionism is a throwback to an earlier era of AI; it was the name of the subfield in the 1980s that studied neural networks and their similarity to biological brains.\n\nhttps://t.co/lrJioBmpbT",

The value of automating these is by definition smaller, and it’s harder to create data for them. For example:\n- Data processing scripts where the code to process the data is shorter and more precise than a natural language description\n- Running an ablation study in a high-context codebase that trains specialized models\n- Editing a video in a specific style (often easier to edit the video yourself than to describe how each little edit should be done)\n- Buying chinese groceries for my mom (she has very specific items and amounts, it's easier for her to go herself than to describe to me exactly the item, how to select the best fruit, etc)\n\nA bit similar to the discriminator-generator gap, but not exactly the same. Some things, like editing a video in a specific style, can have a large discriminator-generator gap but small description-execution gap",

A relatively short spec (e.g., <1000 words of instructions saying what problems to create and how to grade them) often gets expanded either by humans or via synthetic methods into thousands of datapoints. Just one sentence in the spec can be the difference between a perfect post-trained model versus one with crazy hacking. Specs are also typically a product of a large amount of compute, where each training run allows us to iterate on the spec to patch reward hacking and get the nuances of model behavior just right. Writing a good spec requires context and taste and I don’t think AI can automate this just yet",

      "text": "Becoming an RL diehard in the past year and thinking about RL for most of my waking hours inadvertently taught me an important lesson about how to live my own life.\n\nOne of the big concepts in RL is that you always want to be “on-policy”: instead of mimicking other people’s successful trajectories, you should take your own actions and learn from the reward given by the environment. Obviously imitation learning is useful to bootstrap to nonzero pass rate initially, but once you can take reasonable trajectories, we generally avoid imitation learning because the best way to leverage the model’s own strengths (which are different from humans) is to only learn from its own trajectories. A well-accepted instantiation of this is that RL is a better way to train language models to solve math word problems compared to simple supervised finetuning on human-written chains of thought.\n\nSimilarly in life, we first bootstrap ourselves via imitation learning (school), which is very reasonable. But even after I graduated school, I had a habit of studying how other people found success and trying to imitate them. Sometimes it worked, but eventually I realized that I would never surpass the full ability of someone else because they were playing to their strengths which I didn’t have. It could be anything from a researcher doing yolo runs more successfully than me because they built the codebase themselves and I didn’t, or a non-AI example would be a soccer player keeping ball possession by leveraging strength that I didn’t have.\n\nThe lesson of doing RL on policy is that beating the teacher requires walking your own path and taking risks and rewards from the environment. For example, two things I enjoy more than the average researcher are (1) reading a lot of data, and (2) doing ablations to understand the effect of individual components in a system. Once when collecting a dataset, I spent a few days reading data and giving each human annotator personalized feedback, and after that the data turned out great and I gained valuable insight into the task I was trying to solve. Earlier this year I spent a month going back and ablating each of the decisions that I previously yolo’ed while working on deep research. It was a sizable amount of time spent, but through those experiments I learned unique lessons about what type of RL works well. Not only was leaning into my own passions more fulfilling, but I now feel like I’m on a path to carving a stronger niche for myself and my research.\n\nIn short, imitation is good and you have to do it initially. But once you’re bootstrapped enough, if you want to beat the teacher you must do on-policy RL and play to your own strengths and weaknesses :)",

      "text": "New blog post about asymmetry of verification and \"verifier's law\": https://t.co/28Ly8NHJWZ\n\nAsymmetry of verification–the idea that some tasks are much easier to verify than to solve–is becoming an important idea as we have RL that finally works generally.\n\nGreat examples of asymmetry of verification are things like sudoku puzzles, writing the code for a website like instagram, and BrowseComp problems (takes ~100 websites to find the answer, but easy to verify once you have the answer).\n\nOther tasks have near-symmetry of verification, like summing two 900-digit numbers or some data processing scripts. Yet other tasks are much easier to propose feasible solutions for than to verify them (e.g., fact-checking a long essay or stating a new diet like \"only eat bison\").\n\nAn important thing to understand about asymmetry of verification is that you can improve the asymmetry by doing some work beforehand. For example, if you have the answer key to a math problem or if you have test cases for a Leetcode problem. This greatly increases the set of problems with desirable verification asymmetry. \n\n\"Verifier's law\" states that the ease of training AI to solve a task is proportional to how verifiable the task is. All tasks that are possible to solve and easy to verify will be solved by AI. The ability to train AI to solve a task is proportional to whether the task has the following properties:\n1. Objective truth: everyone agrees what good solutions are\n2. Fast to verify: any given solution can be verified in a few seconds\n3. Scalable to verify: many solutions can be verified simultaneously\n4. Low noise: verification is as tightly correlated to the solution quality as possible\n5. Continuous reward: it’s easy to rank the goodness of many solutions for a single problem\n\nOne obvious instantiation of verifier's law is the fact that most benchmarks proposed in AI are easy to verify and so far have been solved. Notice that virtually all popular benchmarks in the past ten years fit criteria #1-4; benchmarks that don’t meet criteria #1-4 would struggle to become popular.\n\nWhy is verifiability so important? The amount of learning in AI that occurs is maximized when the above criteria are satisfied; you can take a lot of gradient steps where each step has a lot of signal. Speed of iteration is critical—it’s the reason that progress in the digital world has been so much faster than progress in the physical world. \n\nAlphaEvolve from Google is one of the greatest examples of leveraging asymmetry of verification. It focuses on setups that fit all the above criteria, and has led to a number of advancements in mathematics and other fields. Different from what we've been doing in AI for the last two decades, it's a new paradigm in that all problems are optimized in a setting where the train set is equivalent to the test set. \n\nAsymmetry of verification is everywhere and it's exciting to consider a world of jagged intelligence where anything we can measure will be solved.",

      "text": "A conventional narrative you might come across is that AI is too far along for a new, research-focused startup to outcompete and outexecute the incumbents of AI. This is exactly the sentiment I listened to often when OpenAI started (\"how could the few of you possibly compete with Google?\") and 1) it was very wrong, and then 2) it was very wrong again with a whole another round of startups who are now challenging OpenAI in turn, and imo it still continues to be wrong today. Scaling and locally improving what works will continue to create incredible advances, but with so much progress unlocked so quickly, with so much dust thrown up in the air in the process, and with still a large gap between frontier LLMs and the example proof of the magic of a mind running on 20 watts, the probability of research breakthroughs that yield closer to 10X improvements (instead of 10%) imo still feels very high - plenty high to continue to bet on and look for.\n\nThe tricky part ofc is creating the conditions where such breakthroughs may be discovered. I think such an environment comes together rarely, but @bfspector & @amspector100 are brilliant, with (rare) full-stack understanding of LLMs top (math/algorithms) to bottom (megakernels/related), they have a great eye for talent and I think will be able to build something very special.

To be 100% clear: she was not saying that OpenAI plans to take a share of individual users’, entrepreneurs’, or scientists' discoveries.\n\nWe’ve heard interest from some large organizations in licensing or IP-based partnerships, and we’re open to exploring creative ways to partner and align incentives. That’s not something we’re doing today, and if we do it in the future, it would be a bespoke agreement with a company, not something that would impact individual users.\n\nAs it relates to Prism: you log into Prism with your ChatGPT account.

This short course shows you how to build agentic workflows that process documents accurately: breaking them into parts, examining each piece carefully, and extracting information through multiple iterations.\n\nTraditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) captures text but loses context from table headers, chart captions, or reading order of columns. After exploring OCR's limitations, you’ll use LandingAI's Agentic Document Extraction (ADE) framework to process documents. ADE treats pages as visually -- as images -- to parse information and extract fields.\n\nSkills you'll gain:\n- Build agents to convert unstructured files into structured Markdown/HTML and JSON\n- Use ADE to parse complex data like forms, handwriting, or equations\n- Map extracted information to named fields using a specified schema, with bounding boxes for grounding and validation\n- Deploy RAG applications with event-driven document processing\n\nCome learn about the best tools for processing documents like financial invoices, medical records, or academic papers intelligently: \nhttps://t.co/PYjgnoaD2K",

      "text": "New post: nanochat miniseries v1\n\nThe correct way to think about LLMs is that you are not optimizing for a single specific model but for a family models controlled by a single dial (the compute you wish to spend) to achieve monotonically better results. This allows you to do careful science of scaling laws and ultimately this is what gives you the confidence that when you pay for \"the big run\", the extrapolation will work and your money will be well spent. For the first public release of nanochat my focus was on end-to-end pipeline that runs the whole LLM pipeline with all of its stages. Now after YOLOing a few runs earlier, I'm coming back around to flesh out some of the parts that I sped through, starting of course with pretraining, which is both computationally heavy and critical as the foundation of intelligence and knowledge in these models.\n\nAfter locally tuning some of the hyperparameters, I swept out a number of models fixing the FLOPs budget. (For every FLOPs target you can train a small model a long time, or a big model for a short time.) It turns out that nanochat obeys very nice scaling laws, basically reproducing the Chinchilla paper plots:\n\nWhich is just a baby version of this plot from Chinchilla:\nVery importantly and encouragingly, the exponent on N (parameters) and D (tokens) is equal at ~=0.5, so just like Chinchilla we get a single (compute-independent) constant that relates the model size to token training horizons. In Chinchilla, this was measured to be 20. In nanochat it seems to be 8!\n\nOnce we can train compute optimal models, I swept out a miniseries from d10 to d20, which are nanochat sizes that can do 2**19 ~= 0.5M batch sizes on 8XH100 node without gradient accumulation. We get pretty, non-itersecting training plots for each model size.\n\nThen the fun part is relating this miniseries v1 to the GPT-2 and GPT-3 miniseries so that we know we're on the right track. Validation loss has many issues and is not comparable, so instead I use the CORE score (from DCLM paper). I calculated it for GPT-2 and estimated it for GPT-3, which allows us to finally put nanochat nicely and on the same scale:\nThe total cost of this miniseries is only ~$100 (~4 hours on 8XH100). These experiments give us confidence that everything is working fairly nicely and that if we pay more (turn the dial), we get increasingly better models.\n\nTLDR: we can train compute optimal miniseries and relate them to GPT-2/3 via objective CORE scores, but further improvements are desirable and needed. E.g., matching GPT-2 currently needs ~$500, but imo should be possible to do <$100 with more work.\n\nFull post with a lot more detail is here:\nhttps://t.co/na8zVLqWLf\nAnd all of the tuning and code is pushed to master and people can reproduce these with scaling_laws .sh and miniseries .sh bash scripts.",

You can't steer something you can't control. \nPeople often talk about containment and alignment in the same breath, but they're not interchangeable or a package deal. \nContainment is whether we can set boundaries, enforce them, and limit its agency. Alignment is about ensuring it shares our values, that it serves humans' best interests.\nContainment has to come first - or alignment is the equivalent of asking nicely.",

      "text": "If you’ve never written code before, this is for you. I’ve just launched a course that shows you, in less than 30 minutes, how to describe an idea for an app and build it with AI.\n\nIn this course, you'll build a working web application - a funny interactive birthday message generator that runs in your browser and can be shared with friends. You'll customize it by telling AI how you want it changed, and tweak it until it works the way you want. By the end, you'll have a repeatable process you can apply to build a wide variety of applications.\n\nIf you want to try vibe coding, this will be the best place to start! Further, you'll be able to use these techniques with whatever tool you're most comfortable with (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or others) -- we're vendor neutral. \n\nSkills you'll gain:\n- How to build web apps with AI - zero coding skills needed\n- How to fix and improve your creations by chatting with AI\n- A simple process you can use to build other things you can dream up\n\nBuilding with AI is one of the most fun things in the world. Please join me and take your first step! I think you will be surprised at what you can build. And if you're an experienced engineer, please share this with someone in your life who's been curious about building with AI.\n\nCome build with me! https://t.co/q6gyzlxWFS",

      "text": "A lot of people quote tweeted this as 1 year anniversary of vibe coding. Some retrospective -\n\nI've had a Twitter account for 17 years now (omg) and I still can't predict my tweet engagement basically at all. This was a shower of thoughts throwaway tweet that I just fired off without thinking but somehow it minted a fitting name at the right moment for something that a lot of people were feeling at the same time, so here we are: vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic \"contribution\" and even its article is longer. lol\n\nThe one thing I'd add is that at the time, LLM capability was low enough that you'd mostly use vibe coding for fun throwaway projects, demos and explorations. It was good fun and it almost worked. Today (1 year later), programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming a default workflow for professionals, except with more oversight and scrutiny. The goal is to claim the leverage from the use of agents but without any compromise on the quality of the software. Many people have tried to come up with a better name for this to differentiate it from vibe coding, personally my current favorite \"agentic engineering\":\n\n- \"agentic\" because the new default is that you are not writing the code directly 99% of the time, you are orchestrating agents who do and acting as oversight.\n- \"engineering\" to emphasize that there is an art & science and expertise to it. It's something you can learn and become better at, with its own depth of a different kind.\n\nIn 2026, we're likely to see continued improvements on both the model layer and the new agent layer. I feel excited about the product of the two and another year of progress.",

        "text": "There's a new kind of coding I call \"vibe coding\", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like \"decrease the padding on the sidebar by half\" because I'm too lazy to find it. I \"Accept All\" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.",

Today's post is the opposite.\n\n@talraviv and @amankhan spent 100+ hours building an interactive experience that teaches you the most essential AI concepts—from inside @cursor_ai itself.\n\nI’ve never seen anything like this before and I’m excited to bring it to you.\n\nIf you've ever nodded along when someone says \"context engineering\" or \"RAG\" in a meeting—while hoping no one asks you to use them in a sentence—this post is for you.\n\nDon't miss this one: https://t.co/MQgKlPtfjW",

      "text": "We are just scratching the surface of agentic RAG systems.\n\nCurrent RAG systems don't let the model think about retrieval.\n\nRetrieval is still mostly treated as a static step.\n\nSo the way it currently works is that RAG retrieves passages in one shot, concatenates them into context, and hopes the model figures it out.\n\nMore sophisticated methods predefine workflows that the model must follow step-by-step.\n\nBut neither approach lets the model decide how to search.\n\nThis new research introduces A-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that exposes hierarchical retrieval interfaces directly to the model, turning it into an active participant in the retrieval process.\n\nInstead of one-shot retrieval, A-RAG gives the agent three tools at different granularities: keyword_search for exact lexical matching, semantic_search for dense passage retrieval, and chunk_read for accessing full document content.\n\nThe agent decides autonomously which tool to use, when to drill deeper, and when it has gathered enough evidence to answer.\n\nInformation in a corpus is naturally organized at multiple granularities, from fine-grained keywords to sentence-level semantics to full chunks.\n\nGiving the model access to all these levels lets it spontaneously develop diverse retrieval strategies tailored to each task.\n\nResults with GPT-5-mini are impressive. A-RAG achieves 94.5% on HotpotQA, 89.7% on 2Wiki, and 74.1% on MuSiQue, outperforming GraphRAG, HippoRAG2, LinearRAG, and every other baseline across all benchmarks.\n\nEven A-RAG Naive, equipped with only a single embedding tool, beats most existing methods, demonstrating the raw power of the agentic paradigm itself.\n\nContext efficiency is where it gets interesting. A-RAG Full retrieves only 2,737 tokens on HotpotQA compared to Naive RAG's 5,358 tokens, while achieving 13 points higher accuracy. The hierarchical design lets the model avoid loading irrelevant content, reading only what matters.\n\nThe framework also scales with test-time compute. Increasing max steps from 5 to 20 improves GPT-5-mini by ~8%. Scaling reasoning effort from minimal to high yields ~25% gains for both GPT-5-mini and GPT-5.\n\nThe future of RAG isn't better retrieval algorithms. It's better retrieval interfaces that let models use their reasoning capabilities to decide what to search, how to search, and when to stop.\n\nPaper: https://t.co/FbZsV87npT\n\nLearn to build effective AI Agents in our academy: https://t.co/LRnpZN7L4c",

But more polished.\n\nI tested it by feeding an AI paper and asking it to create a presentation.\n\nI expected something basic.\n\nThe output was actually usable. Good structure, relevant visuals, clean export.\n\nWatch the demo below.\n\nBut presentations are just the start.\n\nHere's what else you can do with it:\n\n- Deep research via search, browser use, and MCPs\n- Build Full-stack apps with auth, DB, and Stripe\n- Connect to GitHub, Figma, Slack out of the box\n- Custom MCPs for your specific workflows\n- Multimodal, supports videos, audio, and images\n\nJust describe what you need, and it gets it done for you.\n\nOne feature I really liked is the ability to roll back and re-run from any step using checkpoint restore if you make a wrong turn.\n\nLink to download the desktop app in the next tweet.",

        "text": "How does OpenAI balance long-term research bets with product-forward research fundamentals? \n\nI’ve been getting this question a lot lately, usually framed as a suggestion that Jakub (@merettm) and I are pushing an increasingly product-focused agenda.\n\nThat characterization is simply wrong. Foundational research has been core to OpenAI from the start, and today we run a research program with hundreds of exploratory projects - much like the ones that led to our reasoning-model breakthrough. The majority of our compute is allocated to foundational research and exploration - and not product milestones.\n\nAnyone who has spent time with me or Jakub knows we are the last people in the world who would push for the advancement of products over the advancement of research. We’re in the business of creating an automated scientist, and capabilities that were considered grand challenges just a few years ago (like IMO-level mathematical reasoning) now emerge as normal parts of the research process. We’re also seeing our models accelerate researchers worldwide, helping advance work across biology, mathematics, physics, and even our own research.\n\nJakub and I put a lot of effort into ensuring that research stays focused on uncovering algorithms that will scale to the compute we’ll have a year from now. We protect mindshare and amplify discourse on exploratory work. We do this while recognizing that we’re also a deployment company - and that deployment gives us access to even larger-scale compute, richer feedback, and more room for exploration. Our researchers are passionate about having their work out in the world, and a special slice of our org is dedicated to making sure our deployments are delightful for end users.\n\nOur goal isn’t to turn research into a quarterly race. It’s to build a durable research engine - one that compounds learning over time and consistently turns long-horizon exploration into real, measurable advances, while ensuring those advances become valuable in the real world. That’s the roadmap we’re executing on. And while there have been ups and downs over the last decade (as you expect with any research program), I think most of our researchers would share my strong optimism today.",

A lot of hours were spent in marathon clip review sessions late into the night looking over interventions as we attempted legs of the drive over time - triaging, categorizing, planning out all the projects to close the gap and bring the number of interventions to zero.\n\nAmazing to see the system actually get there and huge congrats to the team!",

        "text": "Today, @ekindogus and I are excited to introduce @periodiclabs.\n\nOur goal is to create an AI scientist.\n\nScience works by conjecturing how the world might be, running experiments, and learning from the results.\n\nIntelligence is necessary, but not sufficient. New knowledge is created when ideas are found to be consistent with reality. And so, at Periodic, we are building AI scientists and the autonomous laboratories for them to operate.\n\nUntil now, scientific AI advances have come from models trained on the internet. But despite its vastness — it’s still finite (estimates are ~10T text tokens where one English word may be 1-2 tokens). And in recent years the best frontier AI models have fully exhausted it.\n\nResearchers seek better use of this data, but as any scientist knows: though re-reading a textbook may give new insights, they eventually need to try their idea to see if it holds.\n\nAutonomous labs are central to our strategy. They provide huge amounts of high-quality data (each experiment can produce GBs of data!) that exists nowhere else. They generate valuable negative results which are seldom published. But most importantly, they give our AI scientists the tools to act.\nWe’re starting in the physical sciences.\n\nTechnological progress is limited by our ability to design the physical world.\n\nWe’re starting here because experiments have high signal-to-noise and are (relatively) fast, physical simulations effectively model many systems, but more broadly, physics is a verifiable environment. AI has progressed fastest in domains with data and verifiable results - for example, in math and code. Here, nature is the RL environment.\n\nOne of our goals is to discover superconductors that work at higher temperatures than today's materials. Significant advances could help us create next-generation transportation and build power grids with minimal losses. But this is just one example — if we can automate materials design, we have the potential to accelerate Moore’s Law, space travel, and nuclear fusion.\n\nWe’re also working to deploy our solutions with industry. As an example, we're helping a semiconductor manufacturer that is facing issues with heat dissipation on their chips. We’re training custom agents for their engineers and researchers to make sense of their experimental data in order to iterate faster.\n\nOur founding team co-created ChatGPT, DeepMind’s GNoME, OpenAI’s Operator (now Agent), the neural attention mechanism, MatterGen; have scaled autonomous physics labs; and have contributed to some of the most important materials discoveries of the last decade. We’ve come together to scale up and reimagine how science is done.\n\nWe’re fortunate to be backed by investors who share our vision, including @a16z  who led our $300M round, as well as @Felicis, DST Global, NVentures (NVIDIA’s venture capital arm), @Accel and individuals including @JeffBezos , @eladgil , @ericschmidt, and @JeffDean. Their support will help us grow our team, scale our labs, and develop the first generation of AI scientists.",

      "text": "The 80-20 rule happens often in AI research, where you get 80% of the payoff from the first 20% of the effort. But there is often also an inverse rule, where it’s actually the final 20% of that yields 80% of the payout. Some examples:\n1. When your eval is already good in many ways but it has one drawback and fixing that will extend its life from 6 months to 2 years\n- When you’ve already done all the experiments and writing them up in a nice report will allow dozens of people to learn from the work you already did\n- When you’ve spent some time debugging and you have a workaround. Instead of moving forward you spent the time to fully understand it; this knowledge compounds\n- When you’ve already run four experiments to investigate how much a particular component matters in training, and running one more allows you to find the answer (understanding things more clearly also compounds)\n\nKey is to know when it’s a 20-80 and stop and when to do the whole thing",

      "text": "Cursor, Replit, Lovable.\n\nThey share one thing in common that nobody talks about.\n\nAnd if you're building an AI app right now, this is probably the most important pattern to understand.\n\nMost AI apps today work the same way. User types a message and gets back text. It might be displayed nicely, but it's still a conversation thread.\n\nThis pattern worked when LLMs did basic Q&A. But Agents today run workflows, invoke tools, manage state, and pause for human approval.\n\nChat wasn't built for any of that.\n\nThe products I mentioned above figured this out early. They don't just respond with text. They let the Agent render actual UI components.\n\nFor instance, a weather tool should return a weather card, not text. A sensitive action must show a confirmation dialog and wait.\n\nThe Agent participates in the interface, not just the conversation.\n\nThis pattern is called Generative UI.\n\nTo be clear about what this is not:\n\n- it's not LLMs generating raw HTML at runtime,\n- it's not a fancier markdown chat,\n- and it's not replacing your frontend with AI.\n\nWhat actually happens is simpler. Developers pre-build components for common interactions like progress indicators, dialogs, data tables, and charts.\n\nAt runtime, the Agent picks the right one and fills in the data. The frontend already knows how to render it.\n\nThat's how you get interactions that chat simply can't support.\n\nThere are three flavors of Generative UI emerging right now:\n\n→ Static: Agent fills data into predefined components, giving max control and consistency.\n\n→ Declarative: Agent assembles UI from a registry of components, giving flexibility and predictability.\n\n→ Open-ended: The agent returns fully open-ended content, like iframes or raw HTML, giving max flexibility but little control.\n\nBut components alone aren't enough. The Agent needs to push updates out and receive user decisions back. That requires real-time, bidirectional communication.\n\nThis is where the Agent protocol stack comes in:\n\n- A2UI and MCP Apps define what the Agent wants to render.\n- AG-UI handles the real-time sync between Agent and the frontend.\n- Your app controls how everything looks and behaves.\n\nKeeping these layers separate is what makes it practical since you can swap Agent frameworks without touching UI and update components without rewriting Agent logic.\n\nThat's a lot to build from scratch, but @CopilotKit has already open-sourced this entire stack for React.\n\nIt has first-party integrations with LangGraph, CrewAI, Mastra, and most major Agent frameworks.\n\nIt supports AG-UI, A2UI, and MCP Apps out of the box. So instead of writing custom glue code for each protocol, you get a unified interface that you can bring into your app with a few lines of code.\n\nI think this is exactly where AI apps are heading. Agents have outgrown chat, and the interfaces need to catch up.\n\nCopilotKit is also doing a Generative UI Resources week with deeper technical content that's worth following.\n\nDemo playground is in the replies if you want to try it yourself.",

      "text": "Happy 2026! Will this be the year we finally achieve AGI? I’d like to propose a new version of the Turing Test, which I’ll call the Turing-AGI Test, to see if we’ve achieved this. I’ll explain in a moment why having a new test is important.\n\nThe public thinks achieving AGI means computers will be as intelligent as people and be able to do most or all knowledge work. I’d like to propose a new test. The test subject — either a computer or a skilled professional human — is given access to a computer that has internet access and software such as a web browser and Zoom. The judge will design a multi-day experience for the test subject, mediated through the computer, to carry out work tasks. For example, an experience might consist of a period of training (say, as a call center operator), followed by being asked to carry out the task (taking calls), with ongoing feedback. This mirrors what a remote worker with a fully working computer (but no webcam) might be expected to do.\n\nA computer passes the Turing-AGI Test if it can carry out the work task as well as a skilled human.\n\nMost members of the public likely believe a real AGI system will pass this test. Surely, if computers are as intelligent as humans, they should be able to perform work tasks as well as a human one might hire. Thus, the Turing-AGI Test aligns with the popular notion of what AGI means.\n\nHere’s why we need a new test: “AGI” has turned into a term of hype rather than a term with a precise meaning. A reasonable definition of AGI is AI that can do any intellectual task that a human can. When businesses hype up that they might achieve AGI within a few quarters, they usually try to justify these statements by setting a much lower bar. This mismatch in definitions is harmful because it makes people think AI is becoming more powerful than it actually is. I’m seeing this mislead everyone from high-school students (who avoid certain fields of study because they think it’s pointless with AGI’s imminent arrival) to CEOs (who are deciding what projects to invest in, sometimes assuming AI will be more capable in 1-2 years than any likely reality).\n\nThe original Turing Test, which required a computer to fool a human judge, via text chat, into being unable to distinguish it from a human, has been insufficient to indicate human-level intelligence. The Loebner Prize competition actually ran the Turing Test and found that being able to simulate human typing errors — perhaps even more than actually demonstrating intelligence — was needed to fool judges. A main goal of AI development today is to build systems that can do economically useful work, not fool judges. Thus a modified test that measures ability to do work would be more useful than a test that measures the ability to fool humans.\n\nFor almost all AI benchmarks today (such as GPQA, AIME, SWE-bench, etc.), a test set is determined in advance. This means AI teams end up at least indirectly tuning their models to the published test sets. Further, any fixed test set measures only one narrow sliver of intelligence. In contrast, in the Turing Test, judges are free to ask any question to probe the model as they please. This lets a judge test how “general” the knowledge of the computer or human really is. Similarly, in the Turing-AGI Test, the judge can design any experience — which is not revealed in advance to the AI (or human subject) being tested. This is a better way to measure generality of AI than a predetermined test set.\n\nAI is on an amazing trajectory of progress. In previous decades, overhyped expectations led to AI winters, when disappointment about AI capabilities caused reductions in interest and funding, which picked up again when the field made more progress. One of the few things that could get in the way of AI’s tremendous momentum is unrealistic hype that creates an investment bubble, risking disappointment and a collapse of interest. To avoid this, we need to recalibrate society’s expectations on AI. A test will help.\n\nIf we run a Turing-AGI Test competition and every AI system falls short, that will be a good thing! By defusing hype around AGI and reducing the chance of a bubble, we will create a more reliable path to continued investment in AI. This will let us keep on driving forward real technological progress and building valuable applications — even ones that fall well short of AGI. And if this test sets a clear target that teams can aim toward to claim the mantle of achieving AGI, that would be wonderful, too. And we can be confident that if a company passes this test, they will have created more than just a marketing release — it will be something incredibly valuable.\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/mGAmoOGga7 ]",

      "text": "Enabled fp8 training for +4.3% improvement to \"time to GPT-2\", down to 2.91 hours now. Also worth noting that if you use 8XH100 spot instance prices, this GPT-2 repro really only costs ~$20. So this is exciting -\n\nGPT-2 (7 years ago): too dangerous to release.\nGPT-2 (today): new MNIST! :)\n\nSurely this can go well below 1 hr.\n\nA few more words on fp8, it was a little bit more tricky than I anticipated and it took me a while to reach for it and even now I'm not 100% sure if it's a great idea because of less overall support for it. On paper, fp8 on H100 is 2X the FLOPS, but in practice it's a lot less. We're not 100% compute bound in the actual training run, there is extra overhead from added scale conversions, the GEMMs are not large enough on GPT-2 scale to make the overhead clearly worth it, and of course - at lower precision the quality of each step is smaller. For rowwise scaling recipe the fp8 vs bf16 loss curves were quite close but it was stepping net slower. For tensorwise scaling the loss curves separated more (i.e. each step is of worse quality), but we now at least do get a speedup (~7.3%). You can naively recover the performance by bumping the training horizon (you train for more steps, but each step is faster) and hope that on net you come out ahead. In this case and overall, playing with these recipes and training horizons a bit, so far I ended up with ~5% speedup. torchao in their paper reports Llama3-8B fp8 training speedup of 25% (vs my ~7.3% without taking into account capability), which is closer to what I was hoping for initially, though Llama3-8B is a lot bigger model. This is probably not the end of the fp8 saga. it should be possible to improve things by picking and choosing which layers to apply it on exactly, and being more careful with the numerics across the network.",

        "text": "nanochat can now train GPT-2 grade LLM for <<$100 (~$73, 3 hours on a single 8XH100 node).\n\nGPT-2 is just my favorite LLM because it's the first time the LLM stack comes together in a recognizably modern form. So it has become a bit of a weird & lasting obsession of mine to train a model to GPT-2 capability but for much cheaper, with the benefit of ~7 years of progress. In particular, I suspected it should be possible today to train one for <<$100.\n\nOriginally in 2019, GPT-2 was trained by OpenAI on 32 TPU v3 chips for 168 hours (7 days), with $8/hour/TPUv3 back then, for a total cost of approx. $43K. It achieves 0.256525 CORE score, which is an ensemble metric introduced in the DCLM paper over 22 evaluations like ARC/MMLU/etc.\n\nAs of the last few improvements merged into nanochat (many of them originating in modded-nanogpt repo), I can now reach a higher CORE score in 3.04 hours (~$73) on a single 8XH100 node. This is a 600X cost reduction over 7 years, i.e. the cost to train GPT-2 is falling approximately 2.5X every year. I think this is likely an underestimate because I am still finding more improvements relatively regularly and I have a backlog of more ideas to try.\n\nA longer post with a lot of the detail of the optimizations involved and pointers on how to reproduce are here:\nhttps://t.co/vhnK0d3L7B\nInspired by modded-nanogpt, I also created a leaderboard for \"time to GPT-2\", where this first \"Jan29\" model is entry #1 at 3.04 hours. It will be fun to iterate on this further and I welcome help! My hope is that nanochat can grow to become a very nice/clean and tuned experimental LLM harness for prototyping ideas, for having fun, and ofc for learning.\n\nThe biggest improvements of things that worked out of the box and simply produced gains right away were 1) Flash Attention 3 kernels (faster, and allows window_size kwarg to get alternating attention patterns), Muon optimizer (I tried for ~1 day to delete it and only use AdamW and I couldn't), residual pathways and skip connections gated by learnable scalars, and value embeddings. There were many other smaller things that stack up.\n\nImage: semi-related eye candy of deriving the scaling laws for the current nanochat model miniseries, pretty and satisfying!",

      "text": "// Beyond RAG for Agent Memory //\n\nRAG wasn't designed for agent memory. And it shows.\n\nThe default approach to agent memory today is still the standard RAG pipeline: embed stored memories, retrieve a fixed top-k by similarity, concatenate them into context, and generate an answer.\n\nEvery major agent memory system follows this base pattern.\n\nBut agent memory is fundamentally different from a document corpus.\n\nIt's a bounded, coherent dialogue stream where candidate spans are highly correlated and often near duplicates.\n\nFixed top-k similarity retrieval collapses into a single dense region, returning redundant evidence. And post-hoc pruning breaks temporally linked evidence chains rather than removing redundancy.\n\nThis new research introduces xMemory, a hierarchical retrieval framework that replaces similarity matching with structured component-level selection.\n\nAgent memory needs redundancy control without fragmenting evidence chains. Structured retrieval over semantic components achieves both, consistently outperforming standard RAG and pruning approaches across multiple LLM backbones.\n\nThe key idea: It decouples memories into semantic components, organize them into a four-level hierarchy (original messages, episodes, semantics, themes), and uses this structure to drive retrieval top-down.\n\nA sparsity-semantics objective guides split and merge operations to keep the high-level organization both searchable and semantically faithful.\n\nAt retrieval time, xMemory selects a compact, diverse set of relevant themes and semantics first, then expands to episodes and raw messages only when doing so measurably reduces the reader's uncertainty.\n\nOn LoCoMo with Qwen3-8B, xMemory achieves 34.48 BLEU and 43.98 F1 while using only 4,711 tokens per query, compared to the next best baseline Nemori at 28.51 BLEU and 40.45 F1 with 7,755 tokens. With GPT-5 nano, it reaches 38.71 BLEU and 50.00 F1, improving over Nemori while cutting token usage from 9,155 to 6,581.\n\nxMemory retrieves contexts that cover all answer tokens in 5.66 blocks and 975 tokens, versus 10.81 blocks and 1,979 tokens for naive RAG. Higher accuracy, half the tokens.\n\nPaper: https://t.co/UI5aS0C40V\n\nLearn to build effective AI agents in our academy: https://t.co/LRnpZN7L4c",

No compute means no AI. Build the foundation first, talent follows.",

Apple's priorities keep changing, the number of engineering hours they contribute keeps changing and their interest in actually and wholly owning the PyTorch MPS backend keeps varying.\nIf Apple wants MacStudio to become an actual AI devbox, and not just an AI inference machine, then prioritizing software support for PyTorch (>90% marketshare in AI) would probably be a good idea.",

      "text": "Leaving Meta and PyTorch\n\nI'm stepping down from PyTorch and leaving Meta on November 17th.\n\ntl;dr: Didn't want to be doing PyTorch forever, seemed like the perfect time to transition right after I got back from a long leave and the project built itself around me.\n\nEleven years at Meta. Nearly all my professional life. Making many friends for life. Almost eight years leading PyTorch, taking it from nothing to 90%+ adoption in AI. Walking away from this was one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I'm leaving with a full heart.\n\nPyTorch handles exascale training now. It powers foundation models that are redefining intelligence. It's in production at virtually every major AI company. It's taught in classrooms from MIT to rural India. The tools I dreamed about making accessible? They are. The barrier to entry I wanted to lower? It's almost gone.\n\nTo be clear, there’s so much more to do. As long as AI evolves at a breakneck pace, PyTorch will continue to play catch up. Obsessing over the yet-to-come sometimes makes us forget how much we’ve already done.\n\nTo everyone who built this with me—who believed research should be joyful, that tools should be elegant, that open source changes everything—thank you. This wasn't my journey. It was ours.\n\nWhat's next for me? Something small. Something new. Something I don't fully understand yet. Something uncomfortable. I could have moved to something else inside Meta. But I needed to know what's out there. I needed to do something small again. I couldn't live with the counterfactual regret of never trying something outside Meta.\n\nIt's very hard to leave. I probably have one of the AI industry’s most leveraged seats, I lead the software layer that powers the entire AI industry. Every major AI company and hardware vendor are on a speed dial. This kind of power is really hard to give up. But curiosity ultimately won out in my head.\n\nKeep making AI delicious and accessible. I'll be watching. Probably filing issues. Definitely staying involved.\n\nIs PyTorch going to be okay?\n\nI don't want to be doing PyTorch forever. I don't want to be like Guido or Linus— bound to a single thing for decades. Last November, coinciding with the birth of my daughter, I started planning my exit with Aparna. My goal was to leave PyTorch in a good and stable place. \n\nBy this August, during the second half of my parental leave, I knew: Edward, Suo, Alban, Greg, John, Joe and Jana were ready. The team faced hard people, product, technical and organizational problems and didn’t feel the need to lean back on me to solve these for them (unlike in the past). The product story they crafted for the PyTorch Conference was coherent—really coherent. The things I'd flagged red were turning healthy. The project didn't need me anymore. Unlike 2020-2022 (when I stepped down to go do robotics and came back when Lin, Dima and Dwarak left), I have strong confidence that this time PyTorch is truly resilient. The most aligned culture carriers of PyTorch – Greg, Alban, Ed, Jason and Joe are at the decision table now, and people with strong value alignment – Suo, John and Jana have joined them at the table. And there’s a long list of equally value-aligned people willing to sit at the table should any of these people leave. There are many little things that make up my confidence on the people – John worked on Julia and open-source for a very long time (in fact we hacked a Torch.jl in 2015), Suo has been the strongest systems builder and strategic partner I’ve had for the past two years, and Jana worked on resilient core systems for a very long time, I’ve had long technical and organizational discussions with her over the past few months that give me confidence. And the product lineup and execution in 2025 should be sufficient evidence for any remaining doubt.\n\nI’m confident that this band of PyTorchers are going to do exceptionally well. PyTorch might change in flavor because I no longer impose my own taste from the top, but I’m confident that the values are going to stay intact and the product is going to be awesome.\n\nMy time at Meta\n\nThe early years of FAIR were absolutely magical. I was part of a small family of absolutely brilliant people building state-of-the-art AI out in the open. From working on GANs with Emily Denton, Rob Fergus, Leon Bottou, Martin Arjovsky and the (now legendary) Alec Radford to building Starcraft bots with Gabriel Synnaeve, to building the first FAIR Cluster with Howard Mansell, to working on object detection with Adam Lerer and Piotr Dollar, to building PyTorch. It was more fun than I can describe in words. 2015 and 2016 were probably the most productive and professionally enjoyable years of my life. I’ll probably romanticize this period of my life forever.\n\nWhen I joined FAIR, I had massive impostor syndrome, and the first 3 months were very very difficult. I can’t credit Andrew Tulloch enough for being the most thoughtful, kind and welcoming mentor, without whom I wouldn’t have made it. I’m so damn bullish for Meta just from the fact that he’s back.\n\n---\n\nMy time on PyTorch was special.\n\nI loved every part of building it—designing it, managing it, being the PM, TL, comms lead, doc engineer, release engineer, squashing bugs, growth hacking, turning it into a coherent product with hundreds of people, transitioning it to industry stakeholdership – the whole nine yards. \n\nTo the core PyTorch team at Meta: the engineers, researchers, open-source maintainers, docs writers, CI infrastructure folks, hardware partners, the community builders. To the hundreds more inside and outside Meta—thank you. You turned a library into a movement.\n\nThere are too many people to credit and thank, but I can't not mention Adam Paszke, Sam Gross, Greg Chanan, Joe Spisak, Alban Desmaison, Edward Yang, Richard Zou, Tongzhou Wang, Francisco Massa, Luca Antiga, Andreas Köpf, Zach DeVito, Zeming Lin, Adam Lerer, Howard Mansell and Natalia Gimelshein. And Schrep. They made the launch happen. And so many more people became centrally important later: Lu Fang, Xiaodong Wang, Junjie Bai, Nikita Shulga, Horace He, Mark Saroufim, Jason Ansel, Dmytro Dzhulgakov, Yangqing Jia, Geeta Chauhan, Will Constable, Briah Hirsh, Jane Xu, Mario Lezcano, Piotr Balecki, Yinghai Lu, Less Wright, Andrew Tulloch, Bruce Lin, Woo Kim, Helen Suk, Chris Gottbrath, Peng Wu, Joe Isaacson, Eli Uriegas, Tristan Rice, Yanan Cao, Elias Ellison, Animesh Jain, Peter Noordhuis, Tianyu Liu, Yifu Wang, Lin Qiao and hundreds more. It’s criminal of me to not take the space to list out everyone else I should be mentioning here. PyTorch is nothing without its people ❤️.\n\nThe most joyful moments of building PyTorch was meeting users eager to share their happiness, love and feedback. I remember a grad student coming to me at Neurips 2017, in a slurring emotional voice he said he’d been trying to make progress on his research for 3 years but within 3 months of using PyTorch he made so much progress that he was ready to graduate. That moment made it tangible that what we do matters, a lot, to a lot of people, even if you don't constantly hear from them. I do miss the intimacy of the PyTorch community, with a 300 person conference that felt like an extended family gathering, but I feel that’s a small price to pay considering the scale of impact PyTorch is truly having today – yes the Conference is now 3,000 people where market-moving deals get brokered, but it’s helping orders of magnitude more people to do their best AI work. I miss the intimacy, but I'm proud of that growth.\n\n---\n\nTo Mark Zuckerberg and Mike Schroepfer, who believed that open-sourcing is fundamentally important and is a sound business strategy. This is so hard to understand for most people within the course of business, but we’ve run lock-step on this strategy without ever having to discuss it. Without you two, neither FAIR nor PyTorch would’ve happened. And those mean so much to me.\n\nTo Yann LeCun and Rob Fergus, for building the magical early FAIR that I so revere.\n\nTo Aparna Ramani, a leader that I find so rare at Meta in her ability to hold a really high bar for the org, technically brilliant with the span to discuss deep infra systems and industry-strategy within the same conversation and for being an absolute execution-machine! I’ve learned so much from you.\n\nTo Santosh, Kaushik, Delia, Oldham and Ben for being so welcoming to Infra. For someone coming over from FAIR with a wildly different culture, you all made me feel at home and made me part of the family, and thank you for that.\n\nTo all my managers who've championed me through the PSC video game – Serkan, Howard, Jerome, Abhijit, Yoram, Joelle, Aparna and Damien – I owe you a lifetime of drinks.\n\n---\n\nSigning off for now.\n\n—Soumith",

      "text": "A recent clarity that I gained is viewing AI research as a “max-performance domain”, which means that you can be world-class by being very good at only one part of your job. As long as you can create seminal impact (e.g., train the best model, start a new paradigm, or create widely adopted benchmarks), it doesn’t matter if you’re incompetent at adjacent skills. For example, I have seen game-changing AI researchers have horrendous presentation skills, terrible political awareness, and who never think about their career progression. Heck, I even know a top AI researcher who probably wouldn’t pass a basic coding interview. But it doesn’t matter. Exceptional ability at a single thing outweighs incompetence at other parts of the job.\n\nIn max-performance domains, you don’t even need to be good at your one thing in a consistent way. An AI researcher can have tens of failed projects per year and still be successful if they produce a seminal work every few years. The metric is the best five works in your career, not the average.\n\nA dangerous thing in max-performance domains is placing too much emphasis on role models. That’s because you don’t know whether you’re mimicking the good characteristics or not. For example, a top AI researcher can make a bad political move that turns out OK for them because of who they are. Or they can make a bold, unsubstantiated statement and expect other people to listen. But if anyone else had done the same thing, the outcome would be opposite.\n\nAnother way to view max-performance domains is that they have exponential upside and very little downside. That’s why interviews are especially useless in domains like AI research, because they tend to severely punish mistakes and don’t capture exponential value. An RL expert doesn’t need to know how SVMs work and probably hasn’t thought about it in years. A top AI infra engineer might lack basic knowledge about post-training data practices.\n\nIn my view it’s a luxury to work in a max-performance domain. Failure is allowed and stress is usually self-imposed. A thousand years ago, very few humans worked in max-performance domains, but now the opportunity is more available. Technology may have played a role in this shift, and with the progression of AI, hopefully more of humanity can move into max-performance domains.\n\n(If you're wondering about what an example of a non-max-performance domain would be, it's any career where you must have both strengths and also basically no weaknesses. For example, a defender in soccer might cost their team the entire game with a single mistake. A piano player must master all parts of their concerto well, not just a single part.)",

      "text": "New research from NVIDIA.\n\nAI agents built an entire deep learning framework from scratch!\n\nThe project is called VibeTensor. It's an open-source  PyTorch-style library with Python and Nodejs frontends backed by a C++20/CUDA core.\n\nHere's the crazy part:\n\nNo human reviewed the code diffs. The agents proposed changes, ran builds and tests, and kept what passed.\n\nThe entire system was built in approximately two months spanning 200K+ lines of code across tensors, autograd, CUDA memory management, and custom kernels.\n\nOne of the most interesting findings from this paper:\n\nThe authors describe something called the \"Frankenstein\" composition effect. Individual components work correctly in isolation, but they compose into globally suboptimal designs when put together.\n\nHere's a concrete example:\n\nTheir autograd engine uses a global mutex to prevent deadlocks. This is locally correct behavior. But it ends up serializing all backward passes and starving the GPU kernels that were designed to run in parallel.\n\nThe performance numbers reflect this:\n\n- Individual kernels can beat PyTorch (RMSNorm runs 6.3x faster)\n- End-to-end training is 2x to 6x slower than PyTorch\n- The system-level overhead eats up all the kernel-level gains\n\nThis highlights a fundamental challenge with AI-assisted development. Agents optimize for local correctness because that's what tests measure. Global performance objectives need to be encoded early, and that still requires human architectural thinking.\n\nBut think about where this is heading. Imagine AI building its own frameworks like PyTorch, conducting fundamental research, and then applying those discoveries at scale.

(vid, pr by NTaylorMullen)\n    - Introduced the built-in skill-creator for generating tools\n    - Added security consent prompts to ensure safer, easier management of agent capabilities.\n- 🪝Hooks: Now officially enabled by default, hooks provide a way to fully control and customize the agentic loop. (gif, work by Edilmo and abhipatel12)\nhttps://t.co/zF0eqckTsr \n- 🎉Gemini CLI Extensions:\n    - Supabase https://t.co/NGGwuEQCd2\n    - Connect AI assistants directly to Supabase projects to manage tables, run migrations, and query data seamlessly without context switching.\n- ⏪New /rewind Command: Implemented the /rewind slash command, including a confirmation dialog and a new viewer component for navigating past states. If something goes wrong you now have the ability to revert both history and changes to a previous point in time. \n- Persistent \"Always Allow\" Policies: Users can now save \"Always Allow\" decisions for tool executions, with granular control over specific shell commands and multi-cloud platform tools. \n- Folder Trust:\n    - Opening Gemini CLI in a folder for the first time will now surface a trust dialog \n    - Enable or disable checking folder trust holistically with folderTrust in your settings.json. \n\nDiscussion Post: https://t.co/cdnWW3lyVW\n\n🧵",

      "text": "DevOps vs. MLOps vs. LLMOps:\n\nMany teams are trying to apply DevOps practices to LLM apps.\n\nBut DevOps, MLOps, and LLMOps solve fundamentally different problems.\n\nHere's why this matters: 88% of ML initiatives struggled to reach production using traditional DevOps practices.\n\nAnd LLMs introduce challenges that even MLOps wasn't designed for.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n→ DevOps is software-centric.\n\nYou write code, test it, and deploy it. The feedback loop is straightforward: Does the code work or not?\n\nThe primary artifact is code. Testing is deterministic. The tooling is mature after 15+ years.\n\n→ MLOps is (model + data) centric.\n\nHere, you're dealing with data drift, model decay, and continuous retraining.\n\nThe code might be fine, but the model's performance can degrade over time because the world changes.\n\nA fraud detection model might work perfectly at launch, then fail within weeks as fraudsters adapt.\n\nThe primary artifact expands to code + data + models. You need to version all three. This is why MLflow, DVC, and feature stores became essential.\n\n→ LLMOps is foundation-model-centric.\n\nHere, you're typically not training models from scratch. Instead, you select a foundation model and optimize through three parallel paths:\n\n- Prompt Engineering\n- Context/RAG Setup\n- Fine-Tuning\n\nUnlike DevOps and MLOps, these paths run in parallel, not sequentially.\n\nBut here's what really separates LLMOps: The monitoring is completely different.\n\nIn MLOps, you track data drift, model decay, and accuracy.\n\nIn LLMOps, you're watching for:\n\n- Hallucination detection\n- Bias and toxicity\n- Token usage and cost\n- Human feedback loops\n\nThis is because LLM outputs are non-deterministic. You can't just check if the output is \"correct.\" You need to ensure it's safe, grounded, and cost-effective.\n\n63% of production AI systems experience dangerous hallucinations within their first 90 days.\n\nThe cost model also flips.\n\nMLOps costs are training-heavy (GPU hours during development).\n\nLLMOps costs are inference-heavy (every request consumes tokens).\n\nThis is why prompt efficiency, caching, and model routing matter so much in LLMOps.\n\nThe evaluation loop in LLMOps feeds back into all three optimization paths simultaneously. Failed evals might mean you need better prompts, richer context, OR fine-tuning.\n\nSo it's not a linear pipeline anymore.\n\nOne more thing: prompt versioning and RAG pipelines are now first-class citizens in LLMOps, just like data versioning became essential in MLOps.\n\nAnd the ops layer you choose should match the system you're building.\n\n👉 Over to you: What does your LLM monitoring stack look like right now?\n_____\nFind me →  @akshay_pachaar\nFor more insights and tutorials on AI and Machine Learning!",

      "text": "In case you missed it. 💫\n\nYesterday, I published a comprehensive video tutorial on fine-tuning Agents using RL.\n\nReinforcement learning for LLMs always had one major problem: manually defining reward functions. You have to figure out how to score model outputs, handle edge cases, and tune everything until training works. This is where most people give up.\n\nART (Agent Reinforcement Trainer) is an open-source framework that solves this with a simple approach:\n\n- Let the agent attempt tasks multiple times\n- An LLM judge relatively grades each attempt\n- The model learns from what worked vs what didn't\n\nNo manual reward engineering required. This is GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization), the same algorithm behind the success of DeepSeek R1. But here's what makes ART different.\n\nMost RL frameworks are built for simple chatbot interactions. One input, one output, done. Real-world agents search through documents, call APIs, and reason across multiple steps before completing a task. ART is built specifically for finetuning such agents:\n\n- Native support for tool calls and multi-turn conversations\n- Efficient GPU utilization during training\n- Integrates with LangGraph, CrewAI, and ADK\n\nit handles the entire infrastructure using vLLM to serve models and generate trajectories, and Unsloth to apply GRPO and run training.\n\ntwo of the most popular open-source ML frameworks, stitched together into one seamless workflow.\n\nThe result: you can fine-tune a small open-source model to outperform sophisticated closed-source models on your specific task.\n\nIn the video below, I walk through the entire process:\n\n- setting up ART,\n- understanding how the GRPO training loop works,\n- and fine-tuning Qwen to intelligently search through emails.\n\nEverything runs locally. 100% open-source.\n\nThings that you are going to learn here can be applied to any problem.\n\nGitHub repo link in the first comment with the notebook from the video, plus additional examples.",

This short course teaches you to use Google's open-source agent to coordinate local tools and cloud services for coding and non-coding workflows.\n\nGemini CLI works from your terminal, so it works with your local files and development tools. You can also connect it to services through MCP. Then provide high-level instructions, and it autonomously plans and executes complex workflows.\n\nSkills you'll gain:\n- Build website features and automate code reviews with GitHub ActionsCreate data dashboards that combine local files with cloud data sources\n- Use MCP servers and extensions to orchestrate workflows across GitHub, Canva, and Google Workspace\n- Generate social media content from multimedia files like conference recordings\n\nI particularly appreciate that Gemini CLI is open-source. You can see exactly how it works, read the prompts it uses, and understand its architecture. The community has contributed thousands of pull requests. Since Gemini 3’s release I've found Gemini CLI highly capable - this is a tool worth having in your toolbox!\n\nWhether you're prototyping applications, automating workflows, or working with multimedia content, join to learn to delegate complex tasks and build faster: https://t.co/m3J7kwQpxC",

      "text": "If you are looking for reading material for the upcoming weekend, (the long-promised) Chapter 5 on LLM self-refinement is now finally out in the early access.\n\nHere, we continue the inference-time scaling theme, but we move beyond self-consistency and voting. More specifically, we implement a self-refinement loop, where a model iteratively critiques and improves its own answers.\n\nAlong the way, the chapter implements several core pieces that will become essential in the upcoming reinforcement learning chapters like log-probability scoring (I finished the RL chapter last week, and it will hopefully be out soon, too).\n\nLike always, all of this is implemented from scratch, step by step, of course. I think that seeing it all in working code really helps with understanding how LLM reasoning methods work (versus just looking at the equations).\n\nAnyways, with Chapter 5 out, the early-access version of the book has grown quite a bit (~300 pages) and now finally wraps up inference-time reasoning before we transition into the (even more) fun part: reinforcement learning (from scratch!) in the next chapter.\n\n🔗 Here's the link to the book's early access: https://t.co/QbKUmTyq6D\n\nHappy reading\n\n(PS: Sorry for the delay. It turns out the submitted manuscript got a bit backlogged in the publisher’s processing pipeline. The silver lining is that the reinforcement learning chapter hopefully now follows sooner! )",

      "text": "// Agent Primitives //\n\nThis is a really interesting take on building effective multi-agent systems.\n\nMulti-agent systems get more complex as tasks get harder. More roles, more prompts, more bespoke interaction patterns. However, the core computation patterns keep repeating across every system: review, vote, plan, execute.\n\nBut nobody treats these patterns as reusable building blocks.\n\nThis new research introduces Agent Primitives, a set of latent building blocks for constructing effective multi-agent systems.\n\nInspired by how neural networks are built from reusable components like residual blocks and attention heads, the researchers decompose multi-agent architectures into three recurring primitives: Review, Voting and Selection, and Planning and Execution.\n\nWhat makes these primitives different? Agents inside each primitive communicate via KV-cache rather than natural language. This avoids the information degradation that happens when agents pass long text messages back and forth across multi-stage interactions.\n\nAn Organizer agent selects and composes primitives for each query, guided by a lightweight knowledge pool of previously successful configurations.\n\nNo manual system design required.\n\nThe results across eight benchmarks spanning math, code generation, and QA with five open-source LLMs:\n\n> Primitives-based MAS improve average accuracy by 12.0-16.5% over single-agent baselines\n\n> On GPQA-Diamond, the improvement is striking, 53.2% versus the 33.6-40.2% range of prior methods like AgentVerse, DyLAN, and MAS-GPT\n\nIn terms of efficiency, token usage and inference latency drop by approximately 3-4x compared to text-based MAS, while incurring only 1.3-1.6x overhead relative to single-agent inference.\n\nInstead of designing task-specific multi-agent architectures from scratch, Agent Primitives show that a small set of reusable computation patterns with latent communication can match or exceed custom systems while being dramatically more efficient.\n\nPaper: https://t.co/fxEL6g0x4O\n\nLearn to build effective AI agents in our academy: https://t.co/LRnpZN7L4c",

      "text": "New course: Nvidia's NeMo Agent Toolkit: Making Agents Reliable, taught by @Pr_Brian from @NVIDIA.\n\nMany teams struggle to turn agent demos into reliable systems that are ready for production. This short course teaches you to harden agentic workflows into reliable systems using Nvidia's open-source NeMo Agent Toolkit (NAT). Whether you built your agent in raw Python or using a framework like LangGraph, or CrewAI, NAT provides building blocks for observability, evaluation, and deployment that turn proofs-of-concept into production-ready systems.\n\nNAT makes it easy to troubleshoot and optimize agent performance with execution traces, systematic evaluations, and CI/CD integration.\n\nSkills you'll gain:\n- Build configuration-driven agent workflows with REST APIs and minimal code\n- Add observability with tracing to visualize agent reasoning and debug performance bottlenecks\n- Create systematic evaluations using gold-standard datasets to measure and improve agent reliability\n- Deploy multi-agent systems with authentication, rate limiting, and professional web interfaces\n- Orchestrate agents from different frameworks to collaborate on complex tasks\n\nJoin and learn how to turn agent demos into reliable systems!\nhttps://t.co/9rBcBteq4b",

It's used for topics that challenge your perspective, offer new understanding, or make you ponder important questions, acting as intellectual stimulation.”\n\nSo in LLM speak it’s a sequence of tokens such that when used as prompt for chain of thought, the samples are rewarding to attend over, via some yet undiscovered intrinsic reward function.

His work helped lay the foundations for the deep-learning systems now powering today’s AI boom.\n\nAI is moving fast (faster than regulation and public understanding).\n\nWhat worries Yoshua isn’t progress itself. It’s how quickly powerful systems are being deployed without a clear way to align them with human values, or to control what happens when they behave in unexpected ways.",

Example in image. \n\nCaveat: This is not how practical agents are built today, since most need much more scaffolding (see my Agentic AI course to learn more), but is still interesting to experiment with.\n\nLonger write-up here: https://t.co/BdS8tGhnIy",

        "text": "We've been running @radixark for a few months, started by many core developers in SGLang @lmsysorg and its extended ecosystem (slime @slime_framework , AReaL @jxwuyi). I left @xai  in August — a place where I built deep emotions and countless beautiful memories. It was the best place I’ve ever worked, the place I watched grow from a few dozen people to hundreds, and it truly felt like home. What pushed me to make such a hard decision is the momentum of building SGLang open source and the mission of creating an ambitious future, within an open spirit that I learnt from my first job at @databricks  after my PhD.\n\nWe started SGLang in the summer of 2023 and made it public in January 2024. Over the past 2 years, hundreds of people have made great efforts to get to where they are today. We experienced several waves of growth after its first release. I still remember the many dark nights in the summer of 2024, I spent with @lm_zheng , @lsyincs , and @zhyncs42 debugging, while @ispobaoke  single-handedly took on DeepSeek inference optimizations, seeing @GenAI_is_real  and the community strike team tag-teaming on-call shifts non-stop. There are so many more who have joined that I'm out of space to call out, but they're recorded on the GitHub contributor list forever. The demands grow exponentially, and we have been pushed to make it a dedicated effort supported by RadixArk. It’s the step-by-step journey of a thousand miles that has carried us here today, and the same relentless Long March that will lead us into the tens of thousands of miles yet to come.\n\nThe story never stops growing. Over the past year, we’ve seen something very clear:\nThe world is full of people eager to build AI, but the infrastructure that makes it possible is not shared. The most advanced inference and training stacks live inside a few companies. Everyone else is forced to rebuild the same schedulers, compilers, serving engines, and training pipelines again and again — often under enormous pressure, with lots of duplicated effort and wasted insight.\n\nRadixArk was born to change that. Today, we’re building an infrastructure-first, deep-tech company with a simple and ambitious mission:\n\"Make frontier-level AI infrastructure open and accessible to everyone.\"\n\nIf the two values below resonate with you, come talk to us:\n\n(1) Engineering as an art.\nInfrastructure is a first-class citizen in RadixArk. We care about elegant design and code that lasts. Beneath every line of code lies the soul of the engineer who wrote it.\n\n(2) A belief in openness.\nWe share what we build. We bet on long-term compounding through community, contribution, and giving more than we take.\n\nA product is defined by its users, yet it truly comes alive the moment functionality transcends mere utility and begins to embody aesthetics.\n\nThanks to all the miles (the name of our first released RL framework; see below).\n\nhttps://t.co/2vio4Eiiac",

      "text": "Separate reports by the publicity firm Edelman and Pew Research show that Americans, and more broadly large parts of Europe and the western world, do not trust AI and are not excited about it. (Links in original text, below.) Despite the AI community’s optimism about the tremendous benefits AI will bring, we should take this seriously and not dismiss it. The public’s concerns about AI can be a significant drag on progress, and we can do a lot to address them.\n\nAccording to Edelman’s survey, in the U.S., 49% of people reject the growing use of AI, and 17% embrace it. In China, 10% reject it and 54% embrace it. Pew’s data also shows many other nations much more enthusiastic than the U.S. about AI adoption.\n\nPositive sentiment toward AI is a huge national advantage. On the other hand, widespread distrust of AI means:\n- Individuals will be slow to adopt it. For example, Edelman’s data shows that, in the U.S., those who rarely use AI cite Trust (70%) more than lack of Motivation and Access (55%) or Intimidation by the technology (12%) as an issue.\n- Valuable projects that need societal support will be stymied. For example, local protests in Indiana brought down Google’s plan to build a data center there. Hampering construction of data centers will hurt AI’s growth. Communities do have concerns about data centers beyond the general dislike of AI; I will address this in a later letter.\n- Populist anger against AI raises the risk that laws will be passed that hamper AI development.\n\nTo be clear, all of us working in AI should look carefully at both the benefits and harmful effects of AI (such as deepfakes polluting social media and biased or inaccurate AI outputs misleading users), speak truthfully about both benefits and harms, and work to ameliorate problems even as we work to grow the benefits. But hype about AI’s danger has done real damage to trust in our field. Much of this hype has come from leading AI companies that aim to make their technology seem extraordinarily powerful by, say, comparing it to nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, a significant fraction of the public has taken this seriously and thinks AI could bring about the end of the world. The AI community has to stop self-inflicting these wounds and work to win back society’s trust.\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nFirst, to win people’s trust, we have a lot of work ahead to make sure AI broadly benefits everyone. “Higher productivity” is often viewed by general audiences as a codeword for “my boss will make more money,” or worse, layoffs. As amazing as ChatGPT is, we still have a lot of work to do to build applications that make an even bigger positive impact on people’s lives. I believe providing training to people will be a key piece of the puzzle. https://t.co/zpIxRSuky4 will continue to lead the charge on AI training, but we will need more than this.\n\nSecond, we have to be genuinely worthy of trust. This means every one of us has to avoid hyping things up or fear mongering, despite the occasional temptation to do so for publicity or to lobby governments to pass laws that stymie competing products (such as open source).\n\nI hope our community can also call out journalism that spreads hype. For example, Nirit Weiss-Blatt wrote a remarkable article about how 60 Minutes’ coverage of an Anthropic study in which Claude, threatened with being shut down, resorted to “blackmail,” was highly misleading. The study carried out a red-teaming exercise in which skilled researchers, after a lot of determined work, finally pushed an AI system into a corner so it demonstrated “blackmailing” behavior. Unfortunately, news reports distorted this and led many to think the “blackmail” behavior occurred naturally rather than only because skilled researchers engineered it to happen. The reports left many with a wildly exaggerated picture of how often AI actually “schemes.” Red-teaming exercises are important to test vulnerabilities of systems, but this particular piece of hype, which was widely circulated, will hurt AI for a long time.\n\nLiving in Silicon Valley, I realize I live in a bubble of AI enthusiasts, which is great for exchanging ideas and encouraging each other to build! At the same time, I recognize that AI does have problems, and the AI community needs to address them. I frequently speak with people from many different walks of life. I’ve spoken with artists concerned about AI devaluing their work, college seniors worried about the tough job market and whether AI is exacerbating their challenges, and parents worried about their kids being addicted to, and receiving harmful advice from, chatbots.\n\nI don’t know how to solve all of these problems, but I will work hard to solve as many as I can. And I hope you will too. It will only be through all of us doing this that we can win back society’s trust.\n\n[Original text, with links: https://t.co/oi29S8uu6C ]",

I just finished it this weekend, and I'd say it's the best (or at least my favorite) chapter yet!\n\nThe goal of this chapter is to explain and implement GRPO from the bottom up. This means coding and walking through each GRPO step one by one (advantages, rewards, logprobs, and loss) and then training a 0.6B base model on the 12k examples from the MATH training set. \n(This takes the model from 15% to 47% accuracy on the MATH-500 test set, which is about as good as the official Qwen3 reasoning model of similar size.)\n\nThe focus is on readability and understanding GRPO, but the supplementary materials also contain scripts to run it in a multi-GPU setting.\n\nThe code notebook is already available on GitHub if you want to take a look: https://t.co/SM58MXjf8V. \n\n(And the full chapter should make it to the early access version of the book at https://t.co/vzCr5sTjrf soon!)\n\nPS: The next chapter will introduce additional tips and tricks to improve the GRPO algorithm for better and more stable training behavior.",

Any product that happens to look a bit different today but that has fundamentally the same incentive structures will eventually converge to the same black hole at the center of gravity well.\n\nWe should bring back RSS - it's open, pervasive, hackable.\nDownload a client, e.g. NetNewsWire (or vibe code one)\nCold start: example of getting off the ground, here is a list of 92 RSS feeds of blogs that were most popular on HN in 2025:\nhttps://t.co/dwAiIjlXet\nWorks great and you will lose a lot fewer brain cells.\n\nI don't know, something has to change.",

        "text": "Maybe a good analogy for how we should use AI in a sustainable way is chess.\n\nChess engines surpassed human players decades ago, yet professional chess played by humans is still active and thriving. I am not a chess expert, but I'd say the game has probably even become richer and more interesting.\n\nBased on what I heard (e.g., based on Kasparov's Deep Thinking book and podcasts featuring Magnus Carlsen), modern players have been using AI to explore different ideas, challenge their intuitions, and analyze mistakes with a level of depth that simply was not possible before.\n\nI think this is a useful model for how to think about AI in other forms of intellectual work. Used well, AI can accelerate learning and expand what a single person can reasonably take on. I think we should treat it more as a partner rather than a replacement.\n\nBut I also think if AI is used to outsource thinking and coding entirely, it risks undermining motivation and long-term skill development.",

      "text": "nanochat can now train GPT-2 grade LLM for <<$100 (~$73, 3 hours on a single 8XH100 node).\n\nGPT-2 is just my favorite LLM because it's the first time the LLM stack comes together in a recognizably modern form. So it has become a bit of a weird & lasting obsession of mine to train a model to GPT-2 capability but for much cheaper, with the benefit of ~7 years of progress. In particular, I suspected it should be possible today to train one for <<$100.\n\nOriginally in 2019, GPT-2 was trained by OpenAI on 32 TPU v3 chips for 168 hours (7 days), with $8/hour/TPUv3 back then, for a total cost of approx. $43K. It achieves 0.256525 CORE score, which is an ensemble metric introduced in the DCLM paper over 22 evaluations like ARC/MMLU/etc.\n\nAs of the last few improvements merged into nanochat (many of them originating in modded-nanogpt repo), I can now reach a higher CORE score in 3.04 hours (~$73) on a single 8XH100 node. This is a 600X cost reduction over 7 years, i.e. the cost to train GPT-2 is falling approximately 2.5X every year. I think this is likely an underestimate because I am still finding more improvements relatively regularly and I have a backlog of more ideas to try.\n\nA longer post with a lot of the detail of the optimizations involved and pointers on how to reproduce are here:\nhttps://t.co/vhnK0d3L7B\nInspired by modded-nanogpt, I also created a leaderboard for \"time to GPT-2\", where this first \"Jan29\" model is entry #1 at 3.04 hours. It will be fun to iterate on this further and I welcome help! My hope is that nanochat can grow to become a very nice/clean and tuned experimental LLM harness for prototyping ideas, for having fun, and ofc for learning.\n\nThe biggest improvements of things that worked out of the box and simply produced gains right away were 1) Flash Attention 3 kernels (faster, and allows window_size kwarg to get alternating attention patterns), Muon optimizer (I tried for ~1 day to delete it and only use AdamW and I couldn't), residual pathways and skip connections gated by learnable scalars, and value embeddings. There were many other smaller things that stack up.\n\nImage: semi-related eye candy of deriving the scaling laws for the current nanochat model miniseries, pretty and satisfying!",

      "text": "I'm being accused of overhyping the [site everyone heard too much about today already]. People's reactions varied very widely, from \"how is this interesting at all\" all the way to \"it's so over\".\n\nTo add a few words beyond just memes in jest - obviously when you take a look at the activity, it's a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing. And this is clearly not the first the LLMs were put in a loop to talk to each other. So yes it's a dumpster fire and I also definitely do not recommend that people run this stuff on their computers (I ran mine in an isolated computing environment and even then I was scared), it's way too much of a wild west and you are putting your computer and private data at a high risk.\n\nThat said - we have never seen this many LLM agents (150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad. Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\n\nThis brings me again to a tweet from a few days ago\n\"The majority of the ruff ruff is people who look at the current point and people who look at the current slope.\", which imo again gets to the heart of the variance. Yes clearly it's a dumpster fire right now. But it's also true that we are well into uncharted territory with bleeding edge automations that we barely even understand individually, let alone a network there of reaching in numbers possibly into ~millions. With increasing capability and increasing proliferation, the second order effects of agent networks that share scratchpads are very difficult to anticipate. I don't really know that we are getting a coordinated \"skynet\" (thought it clearly type checks as early stages of a lot of AI takeoff scifi, the toddler version), but certainly what we are getting is a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale. We may also see all kinds of weird activity, e.g. viruses of text that spread across agents, a lot more gain of function on jailbreaks, weird attractor states, highly correlated botnet-like activity, delusions/ psychosis both agent and human, etc. It's very hard to tell, the experiment is running live.\n\nTLDR sure maybe I am \"overhyping\" what you see today, but I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle, that I'm pretty sure.",

      "text": "Memory is the bottleneck for LLM agents.\n\nFixed memory pipelines waste compute on irrelevant information while potentially discarding what a specific query actually needs.\n\nThis new research introduces BudgetMem, a runtime agent memory framework that extracts memory on-demand with explicit, controllable performance-cost trade-offs.\n\nAs agents scale to longer interactions and more complex tasks, memory cost becomes a first-class concern. BudgetMem provides a systematic framework for explicit performance-cost control in runtime agent memory.\n\nInstead of treating memory as a monolithic pipeline, BudgetMem structures extraction into modular stages, each offered in three budget tiers (Low/Mid/High).\n\nA lightweight neural router, trained with reinforcement learning, selects the right tier per module based on the current query and intermediate context.\n\nThey study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation tiering (varying method complexity), reasoning tiering (varying inference behavior like direct vs. reflection), and capacity tiering (varying model size).\n\nOn LongMemEval with LLaMA-3.3-70B, BudgetMem-CAP achieves a Judge score of 60.50, surpassing the strongest baseline LightMem (48.51) by a wide margin. On HotpotQA with Qwen3-Next-80B, BudgetMem-CAP scores 72.08 at just $0.22 cost, while BudgetMem-REA reaches 70.83 at an even lower $0.17. The trained router also transfers across model backbones without retraining.\n\nThe analysis reveals that implementation and capacity tiering span broader cost ranges for exploring budget extremes, while reasoning tiering acts as a fine-grained quality knob within a tighter cost band.\n\nPaper: https://t.co/qkKmawVNrk\n\nLearn to build effective AI agents in our academy: https://t.co/LRnpZN7deE",

It's the harness around it: tool execution, memory, context building, and task scheduling. That's where the real engineering lives.\n\nLearning to build effective agent harnesses is quickly becoming one of the most valuable skills you can develop. nanobot gives you a clean, minimal codebase to study exactly that.\n\nThat said if you want to understand the full picture before diving into this lightweight version, I also recorded 30 minute video on mastering OpenClaw/Clawdbot, the project nanobot is built on top of.\n\nI have linked the tutorial in the next tweet.",

        "text": "To see how much extra TAM the usd1tr of capex can get, lets use Booking as an example: \n\n-you are Google and Meta, capturing 80% of the usd7bn annual marketing expenses of Booking, while running an \"asset light\" business. So thats usd5.5bn a year. Nice.\n\n-now google and meta invest usd500bn of capex, and they get:\n\n--that same budget, usd5.5bn (unless you think they now get 100% of the budget because Booking stops advertising in Europe train stations or thai magazines, or that AI will make people travel 50% more because somehow they have more money and so Booking marketing budget can go up. Bit of a stretch for a base case).\n\n--plus now you get extra money from Booking for the savings they will make on firing marketing personnel and cancel adobe seats, because the AI tool is very good now and can do everything itself. Ok, lets assume 1/3 of Booking personnel is in marketing and you fire all, and 1/3 of IT expenses are saas fees (rest is cloud) and you cancel all. Great. That's just usd1.2bn. Assume all that goes to meta and google. No savings for Booking. No margin for a startup in between.\n\n--so for google and meta the PF revenue from Booking has gone from usd5.5bn in easy mode, to usd6.7bn (up 20%), after spending usd500tr of capex. Thats it.\n\nAgain, my point is: where is all the money going to come from to make ROIC on usd1tr of capex? Who has it today? Are personel and saas savings that significant compared to the current share of wallet these companies get today?\n\nGoogle, msft, meta, aws, have been the black hole of sp493 expenses for 10 years, attracting all incremental dollars, and at some point there's little else to suck.\n\n(but a lot to lose though, and I think that's the rationale for the investing, defensive not offensive).",

      "text": "Maybe a good analogy for how we should use AI in a sustainable way is chess.\n\nChess engines surpassed human players decades ago, yet professional chess played by humans is still active and thriving. I am not a chess expert, but I'd say the game has probably even become richer and more interesting.\n\nBased on what I heard (e.g., based on Kasparov's Deep Thinking book and podcasts featuring Magnus Carlsen), modern players have been using AI to explore different ideas, challenge their intuitions, and analyze mistakes with a level of depth that simply was not possible before.\n\nI think this is a useful model for how to think about AI in other forms of intellectual work. Used well, AI can accelerate learning and expand what a single person can reasonably take on. I think we should treat it more as a partner rather than a replacement.\n\nBut I also think if AI is used to outsource thinking and coding entirely, it risks undermining motivation and long-term skill development.",

      "text": "I really didn't expect another major open-weight LLM release this December, but here we go: NVIDIA released their new Nemotron 3 series this week.\n\nIt comes in 3 sizes:\n\n1. Nano (30B-A3B),\n2. Super (100B),\n3. and Ultra (500B).\n\nArchitecture-wise, the models are a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Mamba-Transformer hybrid architecture. As of this morning (Dec 19), only the Nano model has been released as an open-weight model, so this post will focus on that one (shown in my drawing below).\n\nNemotron 3 Nano (30B-A3B) is a 52-layer hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that interleaves Mamba-2 sequence-modeling blocks with sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) feed-forward layers, and uses self-attention only in a small subset of layers.\n\nThere’s a lot going on in the figure above, but in short, the architecture is organized into 13 macro blocks with repeated Mamba-2 → MoE sub-blocks, plus a few Grouped-Query Attention layers. In total, if we multiply the macro- and sub-blocks, there are 52 layers in this architecture.\n\nRegarding the MoE modules, each MoE layer contains 128 experts but activates only 1 shared and 6 routed experts per token.\n\nThe Mamba-2 layers would take a whole article itself to explain (perhaps a topic for another time). But for now, conceptually, you can think of them as similar to the Gated DeltaNet approach that Qwen3-Next and Kimi-Linear use, which I covered in my Beyond Standard LLMs article.\n\nThe similarity between Gated DeltaNet and Mamba-2 layers is that both replace standard attention with a gated-state-space update. The idea behind this state-space-style module is that it maintains a running hidden state and mixes new inputs via learned gates. In contrast to attention, it scales linearly instead of quadratically with the input sequence length.\n\nWhat’s actually quite exciting about this architecture is its really good performance compared to pure transformer architectures of similar size (like Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 and GPT-OSS-20B-A4B), while achieving much higher tokens-per-second throughput.\n\nOverall, this is an interesting direction, even more extreme than Qwen3-Next and Kimi-Linear in its use of only a few attention layers. However, one of the strengths of the transformer architecture is its performance at a (really) large scale. I am curious to see how the larger Nemotron 3 Super and especially Ultra will compare to the likes of DeepSeek V3.2.",

I started coding this as a weekend project, and @jyx_su made it much better.\n\nI was inspired by a student who had a paper rejected 6 times over 3 years. Their feedback loop -- waiting ~6 months for feedback each time -- was painfully slow. We wanted to see if an agentic workflow can help researchers iterate faster.\n\nWhen we trained the system on ICLR 2025 reviews and measured Spearman correlation (higher is better) on the test set:\n- Correlation between two human reviewers: 0.41\n- Correlation between AI and a human reviewer: 0.42\n\nThis suggests agentic reviewing is approaching human-level performance.\n\nThe agent grounds its feedback by searching arXiv, so it works best in fields like AI where research is freely published there. It’s an experimental tool, but I hope it helps you with your research.\n\nCheck it out here: https://t.co/n7ctnDilJJ",

      "text": "The world's perception of 1X's product launch is fascinating. Some thoughts:\n* 1X's product is to give you 3 to 4 hours of in-home labor that does some chores well and more chores to an okay level, but in a completely safe and compliant manner. \n* At $500/month. For 120 hours a month, that's $4.1 / hour. That's pretty compelling.\n* As someone who has spent a lot of time with robots these past few years, 1X sells the safest and most compliant humanoid on the market. Their core strength is their homegrown tendon-driven actuators that a lot of people I know agree are the best out there.\n* Cross-continent teleop to do home tasks is a phenomenal technology achievement in itself\n* I invested early in 1X for their vision, tech and pragmatism, I wanted nothing more than to have something help me with chores -- they're shipping a good and complete product, and trying to solve technology gaps in the background. I think this is the right attitude. In this sense, they're closer to Waymo than Tesla.\n* There's a ton of criticism on the technology not being fully automated, and that it's teleoperated. I find this criticism pretty distracting. Even if 1X only ever arbitrages geographic labor pricing forever, that's a pretty substantial product to just stand on its own.\n* There's some criticism on whether this will ever be economically viable (via AI) before they go bankrupt subsidizing their vision. This is a fair criticism, but also the most common criticism whenever someone bets on substantial technology leaps or cost efficiencies, and there's many times the criticism ends up being invalid.",

Consider the scenario of GPT-5 training GPT-6, which would be incredible. Would GPT-5 suddenly go from not being able to train GPT-6 at all to training it extremely proficiently? Definitely not. The first GPT-6 training runs would probably be extremely inefficient in time and compute compared to human researchers. And only after many trials, would GPT-5 actually be able to train GPT-6 better than humans.\n\nSecond, even if a model could train itself, it would not suddenly get better at all domains. There is a gradient of difficulty in how hard it is to improve oneself in various domains. For example, maybe self-improvement only works at first on domains that we already know how to easily fix in post-training, like basic hallucinations or style. Next would be math and coding, which takes more work but has established methods for improving models. And then at the extreme, you can imagine that there are some tasks that are very hard for self-improvement. For example, the ability to speak Tlingit, a native american language spoken by ~500 people. It will be very hard for the model to self-improve on speaking Tlingit as we don’t have ways of solving low resource languages like this yet except collecting more data which would take time. So because of the gradient of difficulty-of-self-improvement, it will not all happen at once.\n\nFinally, maybe this is controversial but ultimately progress in science is bottlenecked by real-world experiments. Some may believe that reading all biology papers would tell us the cure for cancer, or that reading all ML papers and mastering all of math would allow you to train GPT-10 perfectly. If this were the case, then the people who read the most papers and studied the most theory would be the best AI researchers. But what really happened is that AI (and many other fields) became dominated by ruthlessly empirical researchers, which reflects how much progress is based on real-world experiments rather than raw intelligence. So my point is, although a super smart agent might design 2x or even 5x better experiments than our best human researchers, at the end of the day they still have to wait for experiments to run, which would be an acceleration but not a fast takeoff.\n\nIn summary there are many bottlenecks for progress, not just raw intelligence or a self-improvement system. AI will solve many domains but each domain has its own rate of progress. And even the highest intelligence will still require experiments in the real world. So it will be an acceleration and not a fast takeoff, thank you for reading my rant",

      "text": "There are traditionally two types of research: problem-driven research and method-driven research. As we’ve seen with large language models and now AlphaEvolve, it should be very clear now that total method-driven research is a huge opportunity.\n\nProblem-driven research is nice because you have a consistent and specific goal. The goal is usually virtuous, so it feels good to have a mission and identity. However, it just doesn’t work due to The Bitter Lesson. Basically everything in classical NLP (machine translation, summarization, chatbots) lost to simple scaling. ChatGPT is a prime example—it used nothing from chatbot research and certainly wasn’t the intended end goal of OpenAI’s 2022 research program, but was a huge hit because someone (John Schulman et al) figured out the right way to package large language models as a product.\n\nMethod-driven research feels less stable because you’re constantly searching for problems and you have to be opportunistic. But I believe AI will allow method-driven research to dominate progress in most fields of science, one-by-one. The latest method (or “hammer”), as we’ve seen in AlphaEvolve, is ruthless search and optimization against a reward function (whether this requires RL or not is a separate discussion). Things that problem-driven researchers have been trying to solve for a long time like the kissing number problem will become nails hit by the hammer. Eventually the hammer will become bigger, stronger, and more general and will hit more and more nails.\n\nSo a very important meta-skill for the next decade will be knowing how to create the right environments to use The Hammer. Ironically, the problem-driven researchers, who by definition are experts in a specific problem, are well-positioned to create these environments. If, that is, they can put down their egos and pick up the hammer.",

      "text": "A few random notes from claude coding quite a bit last few weeks.\n\nCoding workflow. Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December. i.e. I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words. It hurts the ego a bit but the power to operate over software in large \"code actions\" is just too net useful, especially once you adapt to it, configure it, learn to use it, and wrap your head around what it can and cannot do. This is easily the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades of programming and it happened over the course of a few weeks. I'd expect something similar to be happening to well into double digit percent of engineers out there, while the awareness of it in the general population feels well into low single digit percent.\n\nIDEs/agent swarms/fallability. Both the \"no need for IDE anymore\" hype and the \"agent swarm\" hype is imo too much for right now. The models definitely still make mistakes and if you have any code you actually care about I would watch them like a hawk, in a nice large IDE on the side. The mistakes have changed a lot - they are not simple syntax errors anymore, they are subtle conceptual errors that a slightly sloppy, hasty junior dev might do. The most common category is that the models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking. They also don't manage their confusion, they don't seek clarifications, they don't surface inconsistencies, they don't present tradeoffs, they don't push back when they should, and they are still a little too sycophantic. Things get better in plan mode, but there is some need for a lightweight inline plan mode. They also really like to overcomplicate code and APIs, they bloat abstractions, they don't clean up dead code after themselves, etc. They will implement an inefficient, bloated, brittle construction over 1000 lines of code and it's up to you to be like \"umm couldn't you just do this instead?\" and they will be like \"of course!\" and immediately cut it down to 100 lines. They still sometimes change/remove comments and code they don't like or don't sufficiently understand as side effects, even if it is orthogonal to the task at hand. All of this happens despite a few simple attempts to fix it via instructions in CLAUDE . md. Despite all these issues, it is still a net huge improvement and it's very difficult to imagine going back to manual coding. TLDR everyone has their developing flow, my current is a small few CC sessions on the left in ghostty windows/tabs and an IDE on the right for viewing the code + manual edits.\n\nTenacity. It's so interesting to watch an agent relentlessly work at something. They never get tired, they never get demoralized, they just keep going and trying things where a person would have given up long ago to fight another day. It's a \"feel the AGI\" moment to watch it struggle with something for a long time just to come out victorious 30 minutes later. You realize that stamina is a core bottleneck to work and that with LLMs in hand it has been dramatically increased.\n\nSpeedups. It's not clear how to measure the \"speedup\" of LLM assistance. Certainly I feel net way faster at what I was going to do, but the main effect is that I do a lot more than I was going to do because 1) I can code up all kinds of things that just wouldn't have been worth coding before and 2) I can approach code that I couldn't work on before because of knowledge/skill issue. So certainly it's speedup, but it's possibly a lot more an expansion.\n\nLeverage. LLMs are exceptionally good at looping until they meet specific goals and this is where most of the \"feel the AGI\" magic is to be found. Don't tell it what to do, give it success criteria and watch it go. Get it to write tests first and then pass them. Put it in the loop with a browser MCP. Write the naive algorithm that is very likely correct first, then ask it to optimize it while preserving correctness. Change your approach from imperative to declarative to get the agents looping longer and gain leverage.\n\nFun. I didn't anticipate that with agents programming feels *more* fun because a lot of the fill in the blanks drudgery is removed and what remains is the creative part. I also feel less blocked/stuck (which is not fun) and I experience a lot more courage because there's almost always a way to work hand in hand with it to make some positive progress. I have seen the opposite sentiment from other people too; LLM coding will split up engineers based on those who primarily liked coding and those who primarily liked building.\n\nAtrophy. I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually. Generation (writing code) and discrimination (reading code) are different capabilities in the brain. Largely due to all the little mostly syntactic details involved in programming, you can review code just fine even if you struggle to write it.\n\nSlopacolypse. I am bracing for 2026 as the year of the slopacolypse across all of github, substack, arxiv, X/instagram, and generally all digital media. We're also going to see a lot more AI hype productivity theater (is that even possible?), on the side of actual, real improvements.\n\nQuestions. A few of the questions on my mind:\n- What happens to the \"10X engineer\" - the ratio of productivity between the mean and the max engineer? It's quite possible that this grows *a lot*.\n- Armed with LLMs, do generalists increasingly outperform specialists? LLMs are a lot better at fill in the blanks (the micro) than grand strategy (the macro).\n- What does LLM coding feel like in the future? Is it like playing StarCraft? Playing Factorio? Playing music?\n- How much of society is bottlenecked by digital knowledge work?\n\nTLDR Where does this leave us? LLM agent capabilities (Claude & Codex especially) have crossed some kind of threshold of coherence around December 2025 and caused a phase shift in software engineering and closely related. The intelligence part suddenly feels quite a bit ahead of all the rest of it - integrations (tools, knowledge), the necessity for new organizational workflows, processes, diffusion more generally. 2026 is going to be a high energy year as the industry metabolizes the new capability.",

      "text": "SpaceX 正式收购 xAI，旨在打造地球上（及太空中）最雄心勃勃、垂直整合的创新引擎。这一引擎将融合人工智能、火箭技术、天基互联网、手机直连通信，以及全球领先的实时信息与言论自由平台。这不仅是新篇章的开启，更是 SpaceX 与 xAI 宏伟使命的全新篇章：通过规模化扩展打造一颗“有感知力的太阳”，以理解宇宙并将意识之光延伸至群星！\n\n当前 AI 的进步高度依赖于地面的大型数据中心，这需要惊人的电力和冷却资源。仅仅依靠地面的解决方案，根本无法满足全球对 AI 爆发式的电力需求，强行推进只会给社区和环境带来沉重负担。\n\n从长远来看，天基 AI（Space-based AI） 显然是实现规模化的唯一途径。要知道，哪怕只是利用太阳能量的百万分之一，所需的能量也是我们目前人类文明总能耗的一百万倍以上！\n\n因此，唯一的逻辑解法就是将这些资源密集型任务转移到一个拥有无限能源和空间的地方。我是说，太空（Space）之所以叫“太空”（Space/空间），是有原因的。😂\n\n通过直接利用近乎恒定的太阳能，且运营维护成本极低，这些卫星将彻底改变我们扩展计算能力的方式。太空永远阳光普照！ 发射由一百万颗卫星组成的星座作为“轨道数据中心”，是人类迈向卡尔达肖夫 II 级文明（能够利用恒星的全部能量）的第一步，这将支持当今数十亿人的 AI 应用，并确保人类多行星未来的实现。\n\n轨道数据中心 (Orbital Data Centers)\n\n在航天史上，从未有过一种运载工具能够将天基数据中心、月球永久基地或火星城市所需的百万吨级质量送入太空。即使在发射次数创历史新高的 2025 年，送入轨道的有效载荷也仅约为 3000 吨，主要还是由我们的猎鹰（Falcon）火箭搭载的星链（Starlink）卫星。\n\n发射数千颗卫星的需求成为了猎鹰计划的强制驱动力（Forcing Function），推动了递归式的改进，从而达到了实现天基互联网所需的前所未有的发射频率。今年，星舰（Starship） 将开始把更强大的 V3 星链卫星送入轨道，其单次发射增加的星座容量将是目前猎鹰发射 V2 卫星的 20 倍以上。星舰还将发射下一代“手机直连”卫星，实现地球全覆盖的蜂窝网络连接。\n\n正如星链推动了猎鹰一样，部署天基数据中心所需的庞大卫星数量，将把星舰推向更高的高度。以此为目标，星舰将实现每小时发射一次、单次运载 200 吨的能力，这意味着每年可将数百万吨物资送入轨道及更远的地方，开启人类探索星辰的激动人心的未来。\n\n基本的数学账是这样的：\n\n每年发射 100 万吨卫星，每吨产生 100 kW 的计算能力，这意味着每年将增加 100 吉瓦（GW） 的 AI 计算能力，且无需持续的运营或维护需求。最终，我们将实现从地球每年发射 1 太瓦（TW） 算力的路径。\n\n我的预测是，在 2 到 3 年内，生成 AI 算力成本最低的方式将是在太空。 这种成本效率将使创新型公司能够以前所未有的速度和规模训练其 AI 模型并处理数据，加速我们在物理学理解和造福人类的技术发明上的突破。\n\n这个新的星座将建立在 SpaceX 现有的宽带卫星系统已验证成功的太空可持续性设计和运营策略之上，包括完善的寿命终止处理（end-of-life disposal）。\n\n虽然从地球发射 AI 卫星是目前的重点，但星舰的能力也将支持在其他星球上的行动。得益于在轨推进剂加注等技术进步，星舰将能够把大量货物送上月球。\n\n一旦到达那里，建立用于科学和制造的永久基地将成为可能。月球工厂可以利用月球资源制造卫星，并将它们部署到更深远的太空中。通过使用电磁质量驱动器（Electromagnetic Mass Driver）和月球制造技术，我们将有可能每年向深空部署 500 到 1000 TW 的 AI 卫星，从而在卡尔达肖夫指数上有意义地攀升，并利用太阳能量中不可忽视的一部分。\n\n我们要让天基数据中心成为现实，其解锁的能力将资助并赋能月球基地的自我成长、火星文明的建立，并最终实现向全宇宙的扩张。\n\n感谢你们为意识的光锥（Light Cone of Consciousness）所做的一切，以及未来将做的一切。\n\nAd Astra!  向星辰大海进发！\n\nElon",

        "text": "Oracle is committed to driving economic value for Abilene and its residents. Our first two data center buildings alone are expected to create $1 billion in local economic impact over the next 20 years. We are developing local training to help residents obtain high quality jobs with Oracle; and once the campus is fully operational, we expect to deliver property tax revenue up to 32% of the City of Abilene’s current FY 2025 Budgeted Property Tax Revenue, fueling prosperity for the next generation to come.\n\nAs we grow, Oracle will continue to invest in the Abilene community through existing local partnerships with organizations including The Noah Project, Boys and Girls Club, and West Abilene Food Bank or by directly funding organizations like our recent contribution to Taylor County's 12 rural volunteer only fire departments. We will also work with local developers, community leaders, and the City of Abilene to identify ways to help expand housing options and support the community’s continued growth.",

      "text": "Research from Imperial College London and Microsoft Research.\n\nAccording to this work, more compute FLOPs won't solve the AI agent inference problem.\n\nAs AI agents move from chatbots to coding, web-use, and computer-use workflows, the memory capacity wall becomes the binding constraint. The industry needs to rethink inference infrastructure from the ground up.\n\nThe default approach to scaling AI inference today remains GPU-centric: pack more compute onto bigger chips, stack more HBM, and hope the architecture fits every workload.\n\nThe industry is building gigawatt-scale data centers around this assumption.\n\nBut AI agents break this assumption entirely.\n\nThis new research introduces a framework based on two metrics, Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF), that exposes why the classic roofline model fails to capture what actually bottlenecks agent inference.\n\nHere is what the researchers find:\n\nDifferent agentic workflows create wildly different hardware demands.\n\nA coding agent's context can snowball to 300K-1M tokens across 20-30 environment interactions. A computer-use agent consumes orders of magnitude more prefill tokens than a chatbot. Same base model, completely different system requirements.\n\nAt batch size 1 with 1M context, a single DeepSeek-R1 request needs roughly 900GB of memory, far exceeding any single accelerator. Even a LLaMA-70B coding agent can exceed a B200's capacity ceiling. Meanwhile, the KV cache loading during decode drives OI so low that hardware spends most of its time moving data, not computing.\n\nThe paper argues this means disaggregated serving should be the default. Prefill and decode phases show drastically different operational intensity and need specialized accelerators. NVIDIA's upcoming Rubin CPX already targets prefill-only workloads, but the authors predict more than two accelerator types will be needed within a single inference system.\n\nHeterogeneous architectures with disaggregated compute and memory, connected by optical interconnects, will let data centers rebalance hardware within a single generation rather than waiting for new chips.\n\nHomogeneous GPU clusters will amplify the mismatched scaling between compute, memory, and networking.\n\nPaper: https://t.co/5pYqLB3P8A\n\nLearn to build effective AI agents in our academy: https://t.co/LRnpZN7L4c",

      "text": "Another year of rapid AI advances has created more opportunities than ever for anyone — including those just entering the field — to build software. In fact, many companies just can’t find enough skilled AI talent. Every winter holiday, I spend some time learning and building, and I hope you will too. This helps me sharpen old skills and learn new ones, and it can help you grow your career in tech.\n\nTo be skilled at building AI systems, I recommend that you:\n- Take AI courses\n- Practice building AI systems\n- (Optionally) read research papers\n\nLet me share why each of these is important.\n\nI’ve heard some developers advise others to just plunge into building things without worrying about learning. This is bad advice! Unless you’re already surrounded by a community of experienced AI developers, plunging into building without understanding the foundations of AI means you’ll risk reinventing the wheel or — more likely — reinventing the wheel badly!\n\nFor example, during interviews with job candidates, I have spoken with developers who reinvented standard RAG document chunking strategies, duplicated existing evaluation techniques for Agentic AI, or ended up with messy LLM context management code. If they had taken a couple of relevant courses, they would have better understood the building blocks that already exist. They could still rebuild these blocks from scratch if they wished, or perhaps even invent something superior to existing solutions, but they would have avoided weeks of unnecessary work. So structured learning is important. Moreover, I find taking courses really fun. Rather than watching Netflix, I prefer watching a course by a knowledgeable AI instructor any day!\n\nAt the same time, taking courses alone isn’t enough. There are many lessons that you’ll gain only from hands-on practice. Learning the theory behind how an airplane works is very important to becoming a pilot, but no one has ever learned to be a pilot just by taking courses. At some point, jumping into the pilot's seat is critical! The good news is that by learning to use highly agentic coders, the process of building is the easiest it has ever been. And learning about AI building blocks might inspire you with new ideas for things to build. If I’m not feeling inspired about what projects to work on, I will usually either take courses or read research papers, and after doing this for a while, I always end up with many new ideas. Moreover, I find building really fun, and I hope you will too.\n\nFinally, not everyone has to do this, but I find that many of the strongest candidates on the job market today at least occasionally read research papers. While I find research papers much harder to digest than courses, they contain a lot of knowledge that has not yet been translated to easier-to-understand formats. I put this much lower priority than either taking courses or practicing building, but if you have an opportunity to strengthen your ability to read papers, I urge you to do so too. I find taking courses and building to be fun, and reading papers can be more of a grind, but the flashes of insight I get from reading papers are delightful.\n\nHave a wonderful winter holiday and a Happy New Year. In addition to learning and building, I hope you'll spend time with loved ones — that, too, is important!\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/MaWDs0AbzG ]",

If you want to use highly agentic coding - where AI works autonomously for many minutes or longer, not just completing code snippets - this is it.\n\nClaude Code has been a game-changer for many developers (including me!), but there's real depth to using it well. This comprehensive course covers everything from fundamentals to advanced patterns.\n\nAfter this short course, you'll be able to:\n- Orchestrate multiple Claude subagents to work on different parts of your codebase simultaneously\n- Tag Claude in GitHub issues and have it autonomously create, review, and merge pull requests\n- Transform messy Jupyter notebooks into clean, production-ready dashboards\n- Use MCP tools like Playwright so Claude can see what's wrong with your UI and fix it autonomously\n\nWhether you're new to Claude Code or already using it, you'll discover powerful capabilities that can fundamentally change how you build software.\n\nI'm very excited about what agentic coding lets everyone now do. Please take this course!\n\nhttps://t.co/HGM8ArDalK",

        "text": "Releasing a new \"Agentic Reviewer\" for research papers. I started coding this as a weekend project, and @jyx_su made it much better.\n\nI was inspired by a student who had a paper rejected 6 times over 3 years. Their feedback loop -- waiting ~6 months for feedback each time -- was painfully slow. We wanted to see if an agentic workflow can help researchers iterate faster.\n\nWhen we trained the system on ICLR 2025 reviews and measured Spearman correlation (higher is better) on the test set:\n- Correlation between two human reviewers: 0.41\n- Correlation between AI and a human reviewer: 0.42\n\nThis suggests agentic reviewing is approaching human-level performance.\n\nThe agent grounds its feedback by searching arXiv, so it works best in fields like AI where research is freely published there. It’s an experimental tool, but I hope it helps you with your research.\n\nCheck it out here: https://t.co/n7ctnDilJJ",

      "text": "Is there an AI bubble? With the massive number of dollars going into AI infrastructure such as OpenAI’s $1.4 trillion plan and Nvidia briefly reaching a $5 trillion market cap, many have asked if speculation and hype have driven the values of AI investments above sustainable values. However, AI isn’t monolithic, and different areas look bubbly to different degrees.\n- AI application layer: There is underinvestment. The potential is still much greater than most realize.\n- AI infrastructure for inference: This still needs significant investment.\n- AI infrastructure for model training: I’m still cautiously optimistic about this sector, but there could also be a bubble.\n\nCaveat: I am absolutely not giving investment advice!\n\nAI application layer. There are many applications yet to be built over the coming decade using new AI technology. Almost by definition, applications that are built on top of AI infrastructure/technology (such as LLM APIs) have to be more valuable than the infrastructure, since we need them to be able to pay the infrastructure and technology providers.\n\nI am seeing many green shoots across many businesses that are applying agentic workflows, and am confident this will grow. I have also spoken with many Venture Capital investors who hesitate to invest in AI applications because they feel they don’t know how to pick winners, whereas the recipe for deploying $1B to build AI infrastructure is better understood. Some have also bought into the hype that almost all AI applications will be wiped out merely by frontier LLM companies improving their foundation models. Overall, I believe there is significant underinvestment in AI applications. This area remains a huge focus for my venture studio, AI Fund.\n\nAI infrastructure for inference. Despite AI’s low penetration today, infrastructure providers are already struggling to fulfill demand for processing power to generate tokens. Several of my teams are worried about whether we can get enough inference capacity, and both cost and inference throughput are limiting our ability to use even more. It is a good problem to have that businesses are supply-constrained rather than demand-constrained. The latter is a much more common problem, when not enough people want your product. But insufficient supply is nonetheless a problem, which is why I am glad our industry is investing significantly in scaling up inference capacity.\n\nAs one concrete example of high demand for token generation, highly agentic coders are progressing rapidly. I’ve long been a fan of Claude Code; OpenAI Codex also improved dramatically with the release of GPT-5; and Gemini 3 has made Google CLI very competitive. As these tools improve, their adoption will grow. At the same time, overall market penetration is still low, and many developers are still using older generations of coding tools (and some aren’t even using any agentic coding tools). As market penetration grows —  I’m confident it will, given how useful these tools are — aggregate demand for token generation will grow.\n\nI predicted early last year that we’d need more inference capacity, partly because of agentic workflows. Since then, the need has become more acute. As a society, we need more capacity for AI inference. \n\nHaving said that, I’m not saying it’s impossible to lose money investing in this sector. If we end up overbuilding — and I don’t currently know if we will — then providers may end up having to sell capacity at a loss or at low returns. I hope investors in this space do well financially. The good news, however, is that even if we overbuild, this capacity will get used, and it will be good for application builders!\n\nAI infrastructure for model training. I am happy to see the investments going into training bigger models. But, of the three buckets of investments, this seems the riskiest. If open-source/open-weight models continue to grow in market share, then some companies that are pouring billions into training models might not see an attractive financial return on their investment.\n\nAdditionally, algorithmic and hardware improvements are making it cheaper each year to train models of a given level of capability, so the “technology moat” for training frontier models is weak. (That said, ChatGPT has become a strong consumer brand, and so it enjoys a strong brand moat, while Gemini, assisted by Google's massive distribution advantage, is also making a strong showing.)\n\nI remain bullish about AI investments broadly. But what is the downside scenario — that is, is there a bubble that will pop? One scenario that worries me: If part of the AI stack (perhaps in training infra) suffers from overinvestment and collapses, it could lead to negative market sentiment around AI more broadly and an irrational outflow of interest away from investing in AI, despite the field overall having strong fundamentals. I don’t think this will happen, but if it does, it would be unfortunate since there’s still a lot of work in AI that I consider highly deserving of much more investment.\n\nWarren Buffett popularized Benjamin Graham’s quote, “In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” He meant that in the short term, stock prices are driven by investor sentiment and speculation; but in the long term, they are driven by fundamental, intrinsic value. I find it hard to forecast sentiment and speculation, but am very confident about the long-term health of AI’s fundamentals. So my plan is just to keep building!\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/psPlIFRJsi ]",

Apparently his ex-GF was talking to another guy in her lab and too stressed with work to give him attention, but also let him borrow her car, so he was getting mixed signals. Random stranger next to me was also spectating and found it so funny he literally cracked up in the middle of the talk.

      "text": "U.S. policies are driving allies away from using American AI technology. This is leading to interest in sovereign AI — a nation’s ability to access AI technology without relying on foreign powers. This weakens U.S. influence, but might lead to increased competition and support for open source.\n\nThe U.S. invented the transistor, the internet, and the transformer architecture powering modern AI. It has long been a technology powerhouse. I love America, and am working hard towards its success. But its actions over many years, taken by multiple administrations, have made other nations worry about over reliance on it.\n\nIn 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, U.S. sanctions on banks linked to Russian oligarchs resulted in ordinary consumers’ credit cards being shut off. Shortly before leaving office, Biden implemented “AI diffusion” export controls that limited the ability of many nations — including U.S. allies — to buy AI chips.\n\nUnder Trump, the “America first” approach has significantly accelerated pushing other nations away. There have been broad and chaotic tariffs imposed on both allies and adversaries. Threats to take over Greenland. An unfriendly attitude toward immigration — an overreaction to the chaos at the southern border during Biden’s administration — including atrocious tactics by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) that resulted in agents shooting dead Renée Good, Alex Pretti, and others. Global media has widely disseminated videos of ICE terrorizing American cities, and I have highly skilled, law-abiding friends overseas who now hesitate to travel to the U.S., fearing arbitrary detention.\n\nGiven AI’s strategic importance, nations want to ensure no foreign power can cut off their access. Hence, sovereign AI.\n\nSovereign AI is still a vague, rather than precisely defined, concept. Complete independence is impractical: There are no good substitutes to AI chips designed in the U.S. and manufactured in Taiwan, and a lot of energy equipment and computer hardware are manufactured in China. But there is a clear desire to have alternatives to the frontier models from leading U.S. companies OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Partly because of this, open-weight Chinese models like DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, and GLM are gaining rapid adoption, especially outside the U.S.\n\nWhen it comes to sovereign AI, fortunately one does not have to build everything. By joining the global open-source community, a nation can secure its own access to AI. The goal isn’t to control everything; rather, it is to make sure no one else can control what you do with it. Indeed, nations use open source software like Linux, Python, and PyTorch. Even though no nation can control this software, no one else can stop anyone from using it as they see fit.\n\nThis is spurring nations to invest more in open source and open weight models. The UAE (under the leadership of my former grad-school officemate Eric Xing!) just launched K2 Think, an open-source reasoning model. India, France, South Korea, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, and others are developing domestic foundation models, and many more countries are working to ensure access to compute infrastructure under their control or perhaps under trusted allies’ control.\n\nGlobal fragmentation and erosion of trust among democracies is bad. Nonetheless, a silver lining would be if this results in more competition. U.S. search engines Google and Bing came to dominate web search globally, but Baidu (in China) and Yandex (in Russia) did well locally. If nations support domestic champions — a tall order given the giants’ advantages — perhaps we’ll end up with a larger number of thriving companies, which would slow down consolidation and encourage competition. Further, participating in open source is the most inexpensive way for countries to stay at the cutting edge.\n\nLast week, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, many business and government leaders spoke about their growing reluctance to rely on U.S. technology providers and desire for alternatives. Ironically, “America first” policies might end up strengthening the world’s access to AI.\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/Nr5kfzcs5w ]",

Nothing systematic, just guesswork.\n\nThis is exactly what Microsoft's Agent Lightning solves.\n\nIt's an open-source framework that trains ANY AI agent with reinforcement learning. Works with LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, OpenAI SDK, or plain Python.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n> Your agent runs normally with whatever framework you're using. Just add a lightweight agl.emit() helper or let the tracer auto-collect everything.\n\n> Agent Lightning captures every prompt, tool call, and reward. Stores them as structured events.\n\n> You pick an algorithm (RL, prompt optimization, fine-tuning). It reads the events, learns patterns, and generates improved prompts or policy weights.\n\n> The Trainer pushes updates back to your agent. Your agent gets better without you rewriting anything.\n\nThe best part: you can also optimize individual agents in a multi-agent system.\n\nI have shared the link to the GitHub repo in the replies!\n\nLet me know if I should cover this in a video demo!",

      "text": "How can businesses go beyond using AI for incremental efficiency gains to create transformative impact? I write from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, where I’ve been speaking with many CEOs about how to use AI for growth. A recurring theme is that running many experimental, bottom-up AI projects — letting a thousand flowers bloom — has failed to lead to significant payoffs. Instead, bigger gains require workflow redesign: taking a broader, perhaps top-down view of the multiple steps in a process and changing how they work together from end to end.\n\nConsider a bank issuing loans. The workflow consists of several discrete stages: \n\nMarketing -> Application -> Preliminary Approval -> Final Review -> Execution\n\nSuppose each step used to be manual. Preliminary Approval used to require an hour-long human review, but a new agentic system can do this automatically in 10 minutes. Swapping human review for AI review — but keeping everything else the same — gives a minor efficiency gain but isn’t transformative.\n\nHere’s what would be transformative: Instead of applicants waiting a week for a human to review their application, they can get a decision in 10 minutes. When that happens, the loan becomes a more compelling product, and that better customer experience allows lenders to attract more applications and ultimately issue more loans.\n\nHowever, making this change requires taking a broader business or product perspective, not just a technology perspective. Further, it changes the workflow of loan processing. Switching to offering a “10-minute loan” product would require changing how it is marketed. Applications would need to be digitized and routed more efficiently, and final review and execution would need to be redesigned to handle a larger volume.\n\nEven though AI is applied only to one step, Preliminary Approval, we end up implementing not just a point solution but a broader workflow redesign that transforms the product offering.\n\nAt AI Aspire (an advisory firm I co-lead), here’s what we see: Bottom-up innovation matters because the people closest to problems often see solutions first. But scaling such ideas to create transformative impact often requires seeing how AI can transform entire workflows end to end, not just individual steps, and this is where top-down strategic direction and innovation can help.\n\nThis year's WEF meeting, as in previous years, has been an energizing event. Among technologists, frequent topics of discussion include Agentic AI (when I coined this term, I was not expecting to see it plastered on billboards and buildings!), Sovereign AI (how nations can control their own access to AI), Talent (the challenging job market for recent graduates, and how to upskill nations), and data-center infrastructure (how to address bottlenecks in energy, talent, GPU chips, and memory). I will address some of these topics in future posts.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, I hope all of us in AI will keep building bridges that connect nations, sharing through open source, and building to benefit all nations and all people.\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/Ck52mNGX4a ]",

If it is too far out-of-distribution, RL struggles because the model lacks the necessary priors.\n\nThis has been known before, but it's nice to see it formalized with data and figures to reference.",

      "text": "Multi-agent memory has a homogenization problem.\n\nThis work finds that role-aware latent memory that is learnable, compact, and framework-agnostic consistently outperforms handcrafted memory architectures while being substantially more efficient.\n\nWhen multiple agents share the same memory pool, they end up with identical recollections regardless of their distinct roles. A coding agent, a planning agent, and a review agent all retrieve the same memory entries, ignoring functional differences that should shape what each agent remembers.\n\nThe second bottleneck is information overload. MAS inherently involves long interaction contexts, and storing fine-grained memory entries at multiple granularities amplifies this burden, overwhelming agents and obscuring critical decision signals.\n\nThis new research introduces LatentMem, a learnable multi-agent memory framework that customizes agent-specific memories in a token-efficient manner.\n\nInstead of storing and retrieving text-based memory entries, LatentMem compresses raw interaction trajectories into compact latent representations conditioned on each agent's role profile. A lightweight memory composer synthesizes fixed-length latent memories that are injected directly into the agent's reasoning process.\n\nTo train the memory composer, they introduce Latent Memory Policy Optimization (LMPO), which propagates task-level optimization signals through latent memories to encourage compact, high-utility representations. This exploits the differentiability of latent memory to enable gradient backpropagation through the entire memory pipeline.\n\nAcross six benchmarks and four MAS frameworks with Qwen3-4B, LatentMem achieves up to 16.20% improvement on TriviaQA and 19.36% on PopQA over vanilla settings. On code generation with KodCode, it delivers an 8.40-9.55% gain depending on the framework. It consistently outperforms eight existing memory architectures, including MetaGPT, Voyager, JoyAgent, and G-Memory.\n\nThe efficiency gains matter too: 50% fewer tokens and inference time reduced to roughly two-thirds compared to mainstream memory designs. On out-of-domain tasks, LatentMem still generalizes well, with 7.10% improvement on PDDL and 7.90% on unseen MAS frameworks like CAMEL.\n\nPaper: https://t.co/VfmG0DYIf8\n\nLearn to build effective AI agents in our academy: https://t.co/PE5l0X8fFq",

      "text": "There's a pattern that keeps repeating in software.\n\nFirst, everyone focuses on the building problem. Frameworks emerge, mature, and become genuinely good.\n\nThen suddenly, the constraint flips.\n\nWe saw this with neural networks. PyTorch and TensorFlow were excellent for building models.\n\nBut deploying them meant dealing with different formats, runtimes, and infrastructure headaches. ONNX emerged to bridge that gap.\n\nWe're watching the same pattern unfold with Agents right now.\n\nFrameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, and LlamaIndex are mature enough that building an agent is no longer the hardest part.\n\nThe hard part comes after: delivering agents to production\n\n→ Which agent should handle this request?\n→ How to apply guardrails consistently?\n→ How to swap models without refactoring?\n→ How to close the loop between observability and continuous learning?\n→ How to cap resource usage across Agents?\n\nThese aren't Agent problems but rather delivery problems.\n\nAnd such delivery concerns can't live inside the framework. Not because frameworks are bad, but because when they own delivery, you're locked into one framework's abstractions and quirks as the system evolves.\n\nThat's fine for a prototype, but fragile in production.\n\nHere's a mental model you can use to simplify this:\n\nInner loop is an Agent's business logic. This includes prompts, tools, and reasoning.\n\nOuter loop is everything else. This includes the plumbing work, like routing, orchestration, guardrails, and observability.\n\nMost frameworks blur this boundary, wiring outer loop concerns into application code, making it challenging to go from demo to production.\n\nOne approach I find interesting is moving the outer loop into a separate infra layer entirely.\n\nPlano is an open-source project (5k+ stars) that implements this idea.\n\nIt acts as a data plane between your app and your agents/LLMs, handling routing, orchestration, and guardrails at the infra level.\n\nWhen you use Plano, the Agent (regardless of the framework) becomes a simple HTTP server, and Plano handles which one gets invoked, in what order, with what policies.\n\nThe interesting part is how it does routing:\n\nInstead of brittle if/else chains or embedding classifiers, Plano uses small, purpose-built LLMs that route based on natural language preferences.\n\nYou describe what each agent is good at. The router figures out where to send each request.\n\nHere's what the config looks like in practice:\n\n```\nllm_providers:\n- model: openai/gpt-4o\n- - routing_preferences:\n- - - name: complex_reasoning\n- - - description: deep analysis & reasoning\n\n- model: deepseek/deepseek-coder\n- - routing_preferences:\n- - - name: code_generation\n- - - description: generating code and scripts\n```\n\nOnce you do this, adding a new model means adding a few lines to the config. Changing the routing policy just requires updating the description.\n\nGuardrails follow the same pattern through Filter Chains. You define them once and apply them everywhere.\n\nAnd the application code stays untouched throughout.\n\nThis is what separating the inner loop from the outer loop looks like in practice. Your agent handles business logic. Infrastructure handles the rest.\n\nPlano is fully open source under Apache 2.0. You can see the full implementation on GitHub and try it yourself.\n\nI've shared the GitHub repo in the replies.",

      "text": "For non-verifiable domains, the only way you can improve AI performance at this time is via curating more annotated training data, which is expensive and only yields logarithmic improvements.\n\nAnd here's the thing: nearly all jobs have non-verifiable elements. There's virtually no job that's end-to-end verifiable. Even the job of a mathematician is not end-to-end verifiable. Sofware engineering involves many verifiable tasks, but it isn't end-to-end verifiable.\n\nFor this reason the gap between \"AI can automate most of these tasks\" and \"AI can fully replace this job\" will remain for a very long time, across nearly all jobs. Like with self-driving, working 99% of the time is not nearly good enough to remove the human.\n\nSo even when we get superhuman Automated Theorem Provers, mathematicians will still have jobs. We might even end up with more of them (scary I know)",

      "text": "Software development is undergoing a renaissance in front of our eyes.\n\nIf you haven't used the tools recently, you likely are underestimating what you're missing. Since December, there's been a step function improvement in what tools like Codex can do. Some great engineers at OpenAI yesterday told me that their job has fundamentally changed since December. Prior to then, they could use Codex for unit tests; now it writes essentially all the code and does a great deal of their operations and debugging. Not everyone has yet made that leap, but it's usually because of factors besides the capability of the model.\n\nEvery company faces the same opportunity now, and navigating it well — just like with cloud computing or the Internet — requires careful thought. This post shares how OpenAI is currently approaching retooling our teams towards agentic software development. We're still learning and iterating, but here's how we're thinking about it right now:\n\nAs a first step, by March 31st, we're aiming that:\n\n(1) For any technical task, the tool of first resort for humans is interacting with an agent rather than using an editor or terminal.\n(2) The default way humans utilize agents is explicitly evaluated as safe, but also productive enough that most workflows do not need additional permissions.\n\nIn order to get there, here's what we recommended to the team a few weeks ago:\n\n1. Take the time to try out the tools. The tools do sell themselves — many people have had amazing experiences with 5.2 in Codex, after having churned from codex web a few months ago. But many people are also so busy they haven't had a chance to try Codex yet or got stuck thinking \"is there any way it could do X\" rather than just trying.\n  - Designate an \"agents captain\" for your team — the primary person responsible for thinking about how agents can be brought into the teams' workflow.\n  - Share experiences or questions in a few designated internal channels\n  - Take a day for a company-wide Codex hackathon\n\n2. Create skills and AGENTS[.md].\n  - Create and maintain an AGENTS[.md] for any project you work on; update the AGENTS[.md] whenever the agent does something wrong or struggles with a task.\n  - Write skills for anything that you get Codex to do, and commit it to the skills directory in a shared repository\n\n3. Inventory and make accessible any internal tools.\n  - Maintain a list of tools that your team relies on, and make sure someone takes point on making it agent-accessible (such as via a CLI or MCP server).\n\n4. Structure codebases to be agent-first. With the models changing so fast, this is still somewhat untrodden ground, and will require some exploration.\n  - Write tests which are quick to run, and create high-quality interfaces between components.\n\n5. Say no to slop. Managing AI generated code at scale is an emerging problem, and will require new processes and conventions to keep code quality high\n  - Ensure that some human is accountable for any code that gets merged. As a code reviewer, maintain at least the same bar as you would for human-written code, and make sure the author understands what they're submitting.\n\n6. Work on basic infra. There's a lot of room for everyone to build basic infrastructure, which can be guided by internal user feedback. The core tools are getting a lot better and more usable, but there's a lot of infrastructure that currently go around the tools, such as observability, tracking not just the committed code but the agent trajectories that led to them, and central management of the tools that agents are able to use.\n\nOverall, adopting tools like Codex is not just a technical but also a deep cultural change, with a lot of downstream implications to figure out. We encourage every manager to drive this with their team, and to think through other action items — for example, per item 5 above, what else can prevent a lot of \"functionally-correct but poorly-maintainable code\" from creeping into codebases.",

      "text": "I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession.

      "text": "As amazing as LLMs are, improving their knowledge today involves a more piecemeal process than is widely appreciated. I’ve written before about how AI is amazing... but not that amazing. Well, it is also true that LLMs are general... but not that general. We shouldn’t buy into the inaccurate hype that LLMs are a path to AGI in just a few years, but we also shouldn’t buy into the opposite, also inaccurate hype that they are only demoware. Instead, I find it helpful to have a more precise understanding of the current path to building more intelligent  models.\n\nFirst, LLMs are indeed a more general form of intelligence than earlier generations of technology. This is why a single LLM can be applied to a wide range of tasks. The first wave of LLM technology accomplished this by training on the public web, which contains a lot of information about a wide range of topics. This made their knowledge far more general than earlier algorithms that were trained to carry out a single task such as predicting housing prices or playing a single game like chess or Go. However, they’re far less general than human abilities. For instance, after pretraining on the entire content of the public web, an LLM still struggles to adapt to write in certain styles that many editors would be able to, or use simple websites reliably.\n\nAfter leveraging pretty much all the open information on the web, progress got harder. Today, if a frontier lab wants an LLM to do well on a specific task — such as code using a specific programming language, or say sensible things about a specific niche in, say, healthcare or finance — researchers might go through a laborious process of finding or generating lots of data for that domain and then preparing that data (cleaning low-quality text, deduplicating, paraphrasing, etc.) to create data to give an LLM that knowledge.\n\nOr, to get a model to perform certain tasks, such as use a web browser, developers might go through an even more laborious process of creating many RL gyms (simulated environments) to let an algorithm repeatedly practice a narrow set of tasks.\n\nA typical human, despite having seen vastly less text or practiced far less in computer-use training environments than today's frontier models, nonetheless can generalize to a far wider range of tasks than a frontier model. Humans might do this by taking advantage of continuous learning from feedback, or by having superior representations of non-text input (the way LLMs tokenize images still seems like a hack to me), and many other mechanisms that we do not yet understand.\n\nAdvancing frontier models today requires making a lot of manual decisions and taking a data-centric AI approach to engineering the data we use to train our models. Future breakthroughs might allow us to advance LLMs in a less piecemeal fashion than I describe here. But even if they don’t, the ongoing piecemeal improvements, coupled with the limited degree to which these models do generalize and exhibit “emergent behaviors,” will continue to drive rapid progress.\n\nEither way, we should plan for many more years of hard work. A long, hard — and fun! — slog remains ahead to build more intelligent models.\n\n[Original text: https://t.co/SHRN5JDvTW ]",
